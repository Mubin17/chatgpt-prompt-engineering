as we can so just you know either post a / 40.68: message on the message boards and the / 42.06: email catch me after lecture or you know / 44.52: I know it's crazy but you can call me / 45.93: maybe yeah anyway so last time we we / 53.55: left off we were talking about heat / 54.75: capacity of solids and we started with / 63.48: the Boltzmann picture of a solid and / 65.84: Boltzmann's picture both months picture / 70.11: was that an atom in a solid should be / 72.00: thought of as sitting in the bottom of a / 73.65: harmonic oscillator oscillating back and / 75.15: forth and from that picture he was able / 77.73: to derive the law of do long petit heat / 80.73: capacity per atom is three KB it's / 83.58: pretty good result except it didn't / 85.53: agree at low temperature where the heat / 86.88: capacity of solids drops Einstein / 89.40: figured out what was going on he added / 92.49: quantum mechanics and due to quantum / 95.22: mechanics the energy levels of the / 97.53: harmonic oscillator to get quantized and / 99.27: when the temperature drops below the / 101.46: quantization energy the oscillator gets / 103.80: frozen his ground state and the heat / 105.36: capacity drops sea drops at low / 108.27: temperature drops at low T and his / 113.10: prediction was it should drop / 114.99: exponentially exponentially his theory / 121.41: of heat capacity fit the data pretty / 123.27: well and indeed it predicted this drop / 125.73: of heat capacity at low temperature but / 127.80: unfortunately experiment said experiment / 132.14: said that at low temperature the heat / 134.31: capacities are proportional to T cubed / 136.29: not dropping exponentially so that / 140.01: brings us to the subject of today which / 142.38: is the Debye theory if I was 1912 and / 146.40: the devised intuition was that you / 149.25: cannot think of a solid as a bunch of / 151.59: atoms in the bottom of our heart / 153.12: harmonic well because when one atom / 155.22: moves it does get pushed back to its / 157.11: original position by its neighbor but in / 158.94: the process it pushes its neighbor and / 160.38: then his neighbors pushes its neighbor / 161.49: and so forth and so on so in fact what / 164.37: we should be thinking about is the / 166.02: vibration in a solid is actually a wave / 171.56: and in particular vibrational waves are / 175.14: sound now something was already known / 179.91: about how waves behave under the / 182.70: influence of quantum mechanics all the / 184.47: way back in 1899 Max Planck had done / 187.08: this black body radiation calculation / 188.94: and when when Max Planck did this / 190.32: calculation he actually had no idea what / 192.00: he was doing he didn't even like what he / 193.53: was doing he said it was a act of / 195.15: complete despair never really liked the / 197.16: calculation very much but thirteen years / 199.20: later people started to understand / 200.88: little bits and pieces about quantum / 202.20: mechanics and plunks original / 204.21: calculations seem to make a lot more / 206.34: sense / 206.97: so Debye thought that what we should do / 208.74: is we should quantize the sound waves / 210.75: just like light like light the general / 218.91: idea is you know this is in modern / 221.82: language you know plunk didn't / 223.14: understand this but but we understand / 224.70: this now is from Einsteins work we know / 227.19: that the energy of a given oscillator / 229.53: would be H bar Omega times the bose / 233.76: factor beta H bar Omega plus the zero / 237.03: point energy plus one half and so if we / 240.69: have the the picture that the you know / 243.36: of we interpret Planck as now and with / 245.43: Debye understood is that each wave mode / 248.85: in a box in a Menelik you put your / 251.16: material in a box / 251.94: each wave mode in that box should be / 253.59: treated as an oscillator so the total / 256.53: energy e total inside your box is the / 260.40: sum over all wave modes / 262.65: of h-bar Omega for that mode times Lois / 267.84: factor beta H bar Omega for the mode / 271.16: mode plus one half and all you have to / 274.80: do is sum over all the modes in the box / 276.99: now the reason this is going to give you / 278.70: something different from what Einstein / 279.96: had was because whenever you have a / 282.72: bunch of modes in the box some of those / 284.16: modes are going to be low temperature / 286.53: low energy modes or low frequency modes / 288.39: so in Einstein's calculation when the / 291.57: temperature dropped below the frequency / 293.70: of the oscillator then the heat capacity / 296.28: dropped but the idea here is we have a / 298.08: whole distribution of frequencies in the / 299.91: modes in our box and so as we lower the / 301.86: temperature there will always be some / 304.83: modes of low enough frequency that will / 306.57: still have some heat capacity left so / 308.91: the heat capacity won't drop / 310.11: exponentially as we go to low / 312.66: temperature so that's the intuition now / 315.27: there's going to be some differences / 316.71: between what clock did and what Debye / 320.10: did because light is obviously different / 322.83: from sound in many ways one way is that / 324.84: light is of course a lot faster than / 326.46: sound / 326.91: but that's only sort of a quantitative / 329.73: difference there's some more qualitative / 331.89: differences that we're going to have to / 333.06: deal with and one in particular / 335.04: light versus sound is that light has two / 341.43: polarizations of polarizations and sound / 346.71: has three polarizations now you'll / 352.11: remember from your enm that if a light / 354.90: wave is or an electromagnetic wave of / 356.67: any sort is going in the x direction the / 358.89: electric field has to be in the Y / 361.11: direction or the Z direction it can't be / 363.18: in the X direction sound is not like / 365.64: that if a sound wave is going in the X / 367.47: direction the polarization of the sound / 369.78: wave can be in any direction let me show / 371.43: you it's probably easiest to explain / 372.60: this with a movie so let me show you the / 375.54: movie of what I mean by this this is / 377.94: what's known as a longitudinal wave / 380.12: which means that the atoms are moving / 382.92: back and forth in the same direction / 384.90: that the wave is actually going so the / 387.57: wave is going the X direction and the / 389.49: atoms are moving back and forth in the X / 391.68: direction so this doesn't occur for / 394.71: light for light / 396.51: the wave is going the x-direction the / 398.07: electromagnetic field is always pointing / 400.02: in the y direction of the z direction / 400.94: more similar to light is what's known as / 403.35: a transverse wave where the light is / 406.29: good where the wave is going in the X / 408.30: direction but the atoms are actually / 410.16: moving back and forth in the Y direction / 412.77: or the Z direction okay so with sound / 415.68: you can actually have three / 416.76: polarizations the atoms can be moving in / 418.44: any direction whereas in light the / 420.84: electric field has to point in only two / 422.49: possible directions is that clear yeah / 425.19: okay good so we're gonna have to keep / 428.67: track of the fact that we have three / 430.89: polarizations for light and only two for / 434.37: sap the other way around / 435.51: three polarization for sound and only / 437.34: two for light there's a couple of things / 439.41: we're going to also do which are going / 441.36: to be approximations which are going to / 443.70: make our life simpler one is that we're / 445.95: going to assume the velocity of sound V / 450.81: sound is independent of polarization in / 453.90: depth of pull this is not actually true / 459.81: in reality almost always the transverse / 462.57: mode is slower it has a lower velocity / 465.21: than the longitudinal mode but it's / 468.84: actually not so much more complicated to / 470.85: treat this properly but you don't learn / 472.71: a whole lot more from doing it more / 474.48: properly I think there's an exercise in / 476.07: the book that asks you to do it more / 477.27: properly but we're just going to assume / 478.77: all sound waves have the same same / 480.84: velocity independent of whether they're / 482.54: longitudinal or transverse as long as / 486.39: we're assuming things which are not / 488.13: really correct we might as well assume V / 490.98: sound is independent of direction of / 494.45: direction which is often not true also / 498.14: frequently when you have a real solid / 500.16: the speed of sound depends on which / 502.23: direction the solid you're going we'll / 504.21: discuss that a little bit more later on / 505.83: in the term but again it's something / 508.92: that if you treat it more properly it's / 510.21: not that much harder and you don't learn / 511.92: so much more from doing it so we're not / 513.60: going to to do it more properly but just / 516.81: keep in mind that we are making these / 518.37: approximations now if you remember back / 520.47: to plunks calculation which you did last / 524.10: year the first thing you had to worry / 526.17: about was counting all of the modes in a / 528.66: box does that sound familiar / 530.37: a little bit familiar we're gonna go / 532.02: through that again because it's / 533.19: important and we're gonna use a lot of / 534.75: the a lot of the mechanism is to do many / 537.93: other things this year so it's worth / 539.19: going through so this is a little aside / 542.46: on counting waves in a box counting / 544.89: waves modes I guess modes in box so it / 553.17: starts start with a one dimensional box / 554.85: 1d box so let's draw the one dimensional / 558.09: box here it is it has some length L we / 562.80: can write down a wave in that box with / 566.28: hard wall boundary conditions and PI x / 569.01: over L as you know comes to zero at both / 572.46: ends because of the hard wall boundary / 573.87: conditions and this is a perfectly good / 575.64: way to write down the waves in the box / 577.50: for every different positive integer n / 579.15: you have a different wave mode that's / 581.52: okay but it's not not what we're gonna / 582.84: do what we're gonna do is instead we're / 587.19: going to use what's known as periodic / 589.65: boundary conditions you may have / 590.97: discussed this last year periodic / 593.43: boundary conditions boundaries also / 597.57: known as born von-karman boundary / 599.64: conditions born von Karman Carmen Carmen / 605.42: born was one of the Max born was one of / 608.58: the creators of quantum mechanics and / 611.19: Theodore von Karman was a very important / 613.95: mathematician Max Born is also very / 615.66: significant because he was Olivia / 617.07: newton-john's grandfather she's an / 618.60: important pop star if you don't know her / 620.13: she was important for my generation at / 621.99: any rate so anyway people don't see me / 625.80: sufficiently impressed by that statement / 627.75: it's it's actually it's it's anyway okay / 630.03: so the idea of a periodic boundary / 631.53: condition is we're going to take our box / 632.76: of length L and we're going to wrap it / 634.62: up into a circle of circumference L then / 639.87: we're gonna measure X going around the / 641.52: box in this way like that and the reason / 644.61: we're doing this is because once we do / 646.92: this the waves can take the form e to / 649.56: the ikx we don't have to work with sines / 652.23: and cosines if we have a periodic box in / 655.23: a circle we can use Exponential's and if / 657.72: you haven't learned already by this time / 659.64: in your career Exponential's are just a / 661.44: lot easier to work with the / 663.24: signs and co-signs now when we write a / 665.82: wave e to the ikx we have to be a little / 669.09: bit careful because the coordinate X and / 672.51: the coordinate X plus L are actually the / 675.99: same coordinate if you go a distance L / 678.18: around the the box and get back to / 680.61: exactly the same point so this wave form / 683.43: must be exactly the same whether we plug / 685.89: in X or X plus L so we better have you / 690.57: know if this is going to make sense we / 691.71: better have e to the ikx equal to e to / 694.56: the I K X plus L okay or otherwise into / 700.35: the I KL has to equal 1 or K has to be 2 / 705.57: PI over L times an integer N and that / 709.32: integer can be positive or negative or / 711.09: is whatever we like ok everyone happy / 715.08: with that so far so good / 717.21: ok so this means that the spacing / 719.46: between allowed between between allowed / 725.43: allowed Ches Ches is 2 PI over L ll / 732.75: being the circumference of our loop and / 735.36: in particular if we ever have to sum / 737.88: over all the k's we can replace that sum / 740.88: by an integral decay times a factor of L / 744.54: over 2 pi did you go through this / 747.36: argument last year / 748.32: a little bit yes well ok we're going to / 751.29: use it an awful lot this year so that's / 753.33: why I'm going through it again because / 754.65: it's important now we of course don't / 759.18: live in one dimension so we have to / 761.70: think as multi-dimensional people we / 763.74: have to think in multiple dimensions so / 766.11: in 3d we're going to take an L by L by L / 770.19: periodic box periodic box and at this / 776.13: point you might start to be a little bit / 778.14: upset because there's no such thing as / 780.51: an L by L by L periodic box in the real / 783.39: world you would have to have a box for / 785.82: which if you went a distance L in any / 787.98: direction you came back to exactly where / 789.66: you started in three dimensions you / 791.28: can't build such a thing they just don't / 792.87: exist so why is it we're going to do / 794.94: this though the point is you / 796.87: doesn't actually matter what you do with / 798.58: the boundaries of your system for almost / 800.83: any quantity you're actually interested / 802.72: in calculating such as the heat capacity / 804.82: it's something that you could measure / 806.11: locally just in a small region of the / 808.75: actual physical system so it doesn't / 810.79: matter what you would do with the / 811.69: boundaries which could be very very far / 813.31: away so you can use hard wall boundary / 815.83: conditions you can use periodic boundary / 817.21: conditions you can use any other type of / 818.77: boundary condition which is convenient / 820.54: and for us it's convenient to use these / 822.46: periodic boundary conditions and we're / 824.20: going to get away with it the reason we / 826.18: want to use these periodic boundary / 827.35: conditions is because then the waves / 828.73: will look like a TVI cave vector dot X / 831.67: vector it's an exponential Exponential's / 834.49: are easy to work with and that's why / 836.23: we're doing it everyone that's still / 838.00: happy with that okay good so in three / 840.91: dimensions K has to be two PI over L / 844.66: times integers and x and y and and Z and / 848.58: so if we ever have a sum over K vectors / 852.97: we can replace that sum with L over 2 PI / 856.95: cubed times the integral DK X integral / 861.22: DK y integral DK Z or another way that / 865.93: we will most usually write this will / 867.67: write this as the volume of the system / 870.48: times the integral d 3k over 2 PI cubed / 876.33: and we'll see this factored volume / 879.45: integral D 3k over 2 PI cubed probably / 882.91: see it a hundred times this year before / 884.53: we're done ok so what we're going to do / 887.05: is we're going to use what we just / 889.24: learned about counting waves in a box to / 891.70: apply to this equation here so there's / 893.86: some over modes here I can write sum / 896.20: over modes is going to become the sum / 899.98: over all possible K vectors for our / 902.92: modes but then times a factor of three / 905.20: and the factor of three is from the / 907.36: three polarizations we can have one / 909.01: longitudinal or two transverse / 910.51: polarizations and then this sum we're / 913.87: going to use this law here to convert it / 916.24: into an integral so now we have three / 918.82: factor of the volume integral d 3k over / 923.35: 2 PI cubed now since we've assumed over / 929.83: here / 930.82: everything is isotropic you know the way / 933.16: it's philosophies are independent of / 934.75: direction we can then take this three / 937.42: dimensional Cartesian integral and turn / 939.73: it into a spherical polar integral so / 942.55: that we have three times the volume / 944.74: let's pull out the 2 PI cubed here and / 948.07: then we have integral 4 PI K squared / 953.29: DK from 0 to infinity as this familiar / 957.64: the 4 pi is the integral over the / 959.05: spherical directions yes 3 aqua polar / 962.29: coordinates everyone's happy with that / 963.66: finally since we're thinking about sound / 966.88: for sound you've probably learned in / 968.65: your fluids course last year or last / 970.63: less term frequency is proportional to / 974.50: the wave vector and the proportionality / 976.42: constant is the velocity velocity of the / 981.67: sound so let's just change that integral / 984.55: into an integral over frequency instead / 987.25: of an integral over wave vector so that / 989.20: becomes a plus some factors here as pull / 991.42: out a 4 pi upstairs we have a 2 pi cube / 995.70: downstairs I guess we have velocity cube / 999.13: downstairs and then we have an integral / 1000.72: 0 to infinity of Omega squared D Omega / 1004.44: and I'm going to write that as just / 1009.62: defining a quantity G of Omega D Omega 0 / 1014.31: to infinity and this G of Omega is just / 1019.23: a bunch of those constants I'm going to / 1020.55: stick together so I guess I have 12 12 / 1023.85: pi upstairs and I have 2 PI cubed / 1027.00: downstairs I guess I have a velocity / 1029.55: cube downstairs and then I have a volume / 1032.79: upstairs and I'm gonna write the volume / 1034.59: upstairs in sort of a tricky way I'm / 1036.81: gonna write it as the number of atoms / 1038.61: divided by the volume downstairs that's / 1041.49: the density and then the number of atoms / 1043.62: upstairs that's gonna be convenient and / 1046.11: then I need also that Omega squared / 1049.82: Omega squared so this quantity here is / 1053.85: known as which I put it over here G of / 1057.99: Omega is known as G of Omega is known as / 1061.56: the density of states and / 1063.20: think you ran into this last year when / 1065.27: you do blackbody radiation the idea of a / 1068.90: density of states is that it is / 1072.31: basically how many of these modes you / 1075.17: have at a given frequency in particular / 1077.87: G Omega D Omega equals number of modes / 1084.22: with frequency frequency between between / 1092.74: Omega and Omega Plus D Omega so if you / 1099.23: want to sum over all the modes in the / 1101.30: system instead of just summing all the / 1103.46: modes what you do is you integrate over / 1105.05: all frequencies times the number of / 1107.09: modes at each frequency okay sort of a / 1109.81: convenient way to do things / 1111.89: I'm actually also going to simplify this / 1114.89: a little bit further by defining another / 1116.98: convenient quantity I'm gonna rewrite / 1119.60: this G of Omega G of Omega as I'm gonna / 1124.04: write it as pull out the N number of / 1126.71: atoms then nine Omega squared over Omega / 1131.03: D cubed so I'm defining Omega D cubed / 1133.85: here to be a bunch of those constants / 1135.86: stuck together Omega D cubed is 6 pi / 1139.46: squared times the density number over / 1142.70: volume times velocity of sound cubed / 1146.92: this is known as the Debye frequency / 1149.65: after mr. Debye frequency and at least / 1155.51: for now / 1156.23: we're just going to think of it as this / 1157.70: bunch of constants that we've / 1159.23: conveniently defined so it's easier to / 1160.82: write G and in a moment we'll give it a / 1163.01: more important meaning but for now it's / 1164.69: just those bunch of constants okay so / 1169.12: having done all of that we can then way / 1172.13: up there at the very top of the board we / 1173.81: have the expression for the energy as a / 1176.36: sum over all of the modes so I'm / 1179.54: actually maybe I'll put it over here so / 1182.78: I don't have to scroll that off the top / 1184.07: of the board / 1184.70: so we'll now write the energy the total / 1188.51: energy at a given temperature instead of / 1191.21: writing it as a sum over all the modes / 1193.10: I'm going to write it as an integral / 1195.11: over frequencies / 1196.67: equals integral D Omega from 0 to / 1199.79: infinity G of Omega that's the sum over / 1202.10: all modes by integrating over frequency / 1204.77: and the thing that we want to integrate / 1205.91: is H bar Omega bows factor beta H bar / 1209.99: Omega plus 1/2 ok people happy with that / 1215.72: what we're doing yes yes maybe yeah ok / 1219.65: good / 1220.18: all right so this is the expression that / 1223.22: we're going to try to evaluate and if / 1225.56: you're paying really close attention / 1226.51: you'll be upset with me already because / 1229.85: it's actually infinite this total energy / 1233.36: in the box is infinite and the reason / 1235.88: it's infinite is because of this plus / 1237.92: 1/2 look at what the plus 1/2 multiplies / 1241.52: it multiplies a factor of Omega G of / 1243.65: Omega is proportional to Omega squared / 1245.51: so it's the integral of Omega cubed from / 1247.73: 0 to infinity / 1248.78: that's infinite so that's kind of it you / 1251.30: might think that's kind of a problem / 1252.88: actually it didn't bother to buy or / 1254.90: plunk because they didn't know about / 1256.10: zero-point energy so they never wrote / 1257.57: down this plus 1/2 but it's not gonna / 1259.43: bother us either for a number of reasons / 1261.14: the main reason it's not going to bother / 1262.67: us is because it gives us an infinite / 1264.83: quantity but it's an infinite quantity / 1267.35: that's independent of temperature the / 1269.39: only place in this expression where / 1270.95: temperature occurs is right here at the / 1273.08: end of the day we want heat capacity / 1275.09: which is the derivative of the energy / 1276.32: with respect to temperature so we're / 1278.09: gonna have to differentiate this thing / 1279.26: with respect to temperature and the 1/2 / 1281.75: is going to go away because it's / 1282.95: temperature independent so it's giving / 1284.30: us an infinite but temperature / 1286.10: independent contribution so we don't / 1287.72: care about it actually in a few moments / 1289.76: we're gonna see another reason why we're / 1291.29: not gonna care about that 1/2 but for / 1293.51: now we'll just realize it's not going to / 1295.70: change our expression for the heat / 1297.50: capacity all right so now we can plug in / 1301.25: the density of states into this equation / 1303.83: here so let's do that so we get 9 and / 1306.98: I'll pull out the H bar from over there / 1309.17: there's Omega 2 by cubed here cubed / 1312.47: downstairs and then the thing we have / 1315.05: left to integrate integral D Omega from / 1317.75: 0 to infinity / 1318.77: there's Omega cubed upstairs and then / 1321.35: the bose factor e to the beta H bar / 1323.12: Omega minus 1 is left that looks a / 1327.02: little bit ugly but we can take this / 1329.78: integral / 1330.56: we can simplify it a little bit by / 1332.12: writing x equals beta H bar Omega and / 1335.66: then the integral turns into 1 over beta / 1339.05: H bar to the fourth times this integral / 1342.95: integral DX from 0 to infinity of X / 1346.25: cubed e to the X minus 1 and I promise / 1351.14: you no one is ever going to ask you to / 1352.76: evaluate this integral it's just some / 1354.83: number the number happens to be PI to / 1356.81: the fourth over 15 and if you really / 1360.17: want to know where that number comes / 1361.58: from you it's in the you know appendix / 1364.37: of one of the chapters of the book don't / 1366.71: you hate it when someone says you can go / 1367.91: read the book but in fact it's not so / 1369.59: important it just gives us a number the / 1370.85: important thing is it gives us some / 1372.17: known number so we can put that number / 1374.27: in and get the end result that the / 1378.17: energy the total energy in the box is 9 / 1381.86: and KBT to the fourth I'm here divided / 1387.47: by H bar Omega Debye cubed times this / 1391.34: factor part of the fourth over 15 ok / 1397.01: good and then of course we can / 1399.71: differentiate this to get the heat / 1401.42: capacity heat capacity is de DT and okay / 1407.45: so it's n KB KB T over H bar I'll make / 1413.63: it 2 by cubed and then I guess 12 PI to / 1418.16: the fourth over 5 what's so that's the / 1421.58: heat capacity and so a couple of things / 1423.80: to comment about this it makes this / 1425.42: exciting first of all it's proportional / 1427.55: to T cubed / 1428.36: just like the by wanted you get the T / 1430.88: cubed dependence of the heat capacity as / 1433.43: expected it shouldn't be surprising that / 1435.77: you get this T cubed heat capacity / 1437.51: because you remember from the blackbody / 1439.40: radiation calculation you did last year / 1441.89: that the energy of radiation the energy / 1444.14: of waves in a box that you calculated is / 1446.38: proportional to T to the fourth you / 1448.61: should have expected the energy to be T / 1450.14: to the fourth and then you differentiate / 1451.61: it once and you get T cubed so this is / 1453.86: why Debye expected that by treating the / 1455.66: waves the same way we treated radiation / 1458.05: we would get the T cubed law furthermore / 1462.74: there's something really / 1464.21: fighting about this formula here and / 1465.59: that is that there's no free parameters / 1468.47: remember when Einstein did his / 1469.79: calculation he had this frequency this / 1471.53: Einstein frequency the oscillator / 1473.18: frequency which he didn't know how to / 1475.70: come up with this frequency he just fit / 1477.44: it to the experiment to try to make it / 1478.85: all look nice here there's no free / 1480.80: parameter Omega Debye here is fixed by / 1484.52: the density and the sound velocity so / 1487.22: everything is fixed here and if and if / 1488.72: you calculate this quantity and you / 1490.88: compare it to low temperature heat / 1492.17: capacity of most materials it actually / 1494.75: actually agrees extremely well but / 1498.05: unfortunately like you know you never / 1500.48: get anything for free so we still have a / 1503.45: problem problem at high T we want the / 1512.30: law of do long petite C over N is 3 KB / 1515.57: and we didn't get that we got T cubed at / 1518.42: all temperatures here and this is where / 1520.49: the BI had to actually scratch his head / 1522.50: a little bit and think ok what did I do / 1524.39: wrong / 1525.40: incidentally if you do this calculation / 1527.18: for electromagnetic radiation it really / 1530.30: is T to the fourth energy all the way up / 1532.88: to arbitrarily high temperature where as / 1535.34: you know in a solid we know that the / 1537.38: heat capacity the solid at some high / 1539.27: temperature is going to give us just / 1540.50: three KB it's not going to be T cubed so / 1544.60: here we have to deviate from plunks / 1547.22: calculation we have to do something / 1548.39: different from what it was that plunk / 1551.03: did and plunk and Debye understood that / 1555.11: where he was going wrong where he was / 1557.57: going wrong you know he has to think / 1559.31: about where this three comes from where / 1560.87: is this three from the three comes from / 1562.82: the fact that the atom can move in three / 1565.34: directions each atom moves in three / 1567.68: possible directions you can figure this / 1568.94: three degrees of freedom that the atom / 1571.64: has and how many degrees of freedom did / 1574.55: he count in his box well the total / 1577.76: number of modes number of modes that he / 1579.86: counted his integral from 0 to infinity / 1583.01: G Omega D Omega and G of Omega goes as / 1586.88: Omega squared you integrate that into / 1588.38: infinity and that gives you infinity so / 1591.29: he counted an infinite number of degrees / 1593.00: of freedom and he said well wait I'm I / 1595.34: counted an infinite number of modes in / 1597.05: the box but there's a fine / 1598.10: of degrees of freedom each atom can move / 1600.26: in three directions and there shouldn't / 1601.91: be more than that many degrees of / 1603.32: freedom in my box so somehow I have to / 1605.69: fix that problem and make the Box have / 1608.18: only a fixed number of degrees of / 1609.98: freedom not an infinite number of / 1611.33: degrees of freedom so how did he do that / 1613.51: impose a cutoff so what he's going to do / 1619.43: is he's going to declare some frequency / 1622.37: cutoff Omega cutoff G Omega D Omega such / 1629.78: that there are exactly three n modes in / 1632.54: the box now this is an ad-hoc solution / 1636.17: and it's kind of a little weird so what / 1639.23: he's doing is he's saying we have all / 1641.00: these wave modes in a box and when you / 1642.71: get to Psalm a frequency known as the / 1644.99: cutoff frequency above that there are no / 1647.39: more wave modes left you have no sound / 1649.22: moves above this above this frequency / 1650.96: anymore seems a little strange later in / 1653.15: the term we're going to see it's maybe / 1654.14: not as strange as we thought but at then / 1656.48: at that time maybe it seemed a little / 1658.10: odd but he's gonna do it anyway so we're / 1659.87: gonna do this anyway we're gonna follow / 1660.95: him and see what happens first thing we / 1663.89: need to do is we have to figure out what / 1664.94: this cutoff frequency is going to be / 1666.86: such it's going to give us exactly three / 1669.68: n modes so let's calculate this thing / 1671.86: well plug in G Omega so plug in G of / 1675.92: Omega here so there's a nine and there's / 1678.47: Omega two by cubed integral 0 to Omega / 1681.62: cutoff Omega squared D Omega so I just / 1686.54: plugged in G of Omega there and then / 1688.61: let's do that integral and we get three / 1691.40: n Omega cutoff cubed over Omega D I / 1696.59: cubed by cubed and we want this to equal / 1701.06: three N and in order for that to be true / 1703.91: we better choose Omega cutoff equal to / 1708.86: Omega 2 bi okay that's why I happen to / 1713.30: choose those particular constants as / 1715.94: being Omega 2 by Omega 2 by is the / 1718.64: cutoff frequency if you cut off your / 1720.53: Moser at the Debye frequency you only / 1722.72: count modes at lower frequencies in the / 1724.85: Debye frequency you have exactly 3n / 1726.83: modes okay all right so now we're going / 1731.33: to go back to the / 1732.02: equation over here and we're going to / 1734.45: rewrite the total energy in the box now / 1736.82: as the integral counting up modes not to / 1741.65: infinity now I'm only up to Omega 2 by G / 1745.01: Omega and then the bose factor beta H / 1748.67: bar Omega and then plus 1/2 zero-point / 1752.12: energy and you'll notice now because / 1754.49: we've cut off our number of modes this / 1757.13: term no longer diverges it's a finite / 1759.34: zero-point energy term and that makes us / 1761.69: a little bit happier but again we can / 1764.33: actually ignore it / 1765.77: drop this because it's temperature / 1769.34: independent it's a temperature / 1770.63: independent zero-point energy we're / 1772.55: going to differentiate the thing anyway / 1773.93: so we don't really care about it it's / 1775.70: just going to give us some overall / 1776.66: constant shift in the energy which isn't / 1779.27: very interesting so we're going to drop / 1780.71: that anyway ok and then this expression / 1783.98: should give us the energy in the box or / 1785.63: the heat capacity in the box once we / 1786.86: differentiate it at any temperature we / 1788.63: choose just by plugging the temperature / 1790.52: in here but it's useful to look at / 1793.34: various limits so the first limit is low / 1795.98: temperature limit and by that I mean KBT / 1799.69: much less than h-bar omega Debye and in / 1803.72: this limit we get the same result same / 1806.39: result as we had before this result here / 1810.44: exactly this nothing changes why is that / 1813.62: well the reason nothing changes is / 1816.17: because at low temperature this bose / 1818.60: factor vanishes very quickly with / 1821.15: frequency by the time you're up near the / 1823.55: Debye frequency the bose factor is / 1825.59: essentially zero anyway so it doesn't / 1827.33: matter if you cut it off at the Debye / 1828.65: frequency or twice the Debye frequency / 1829.97: or half the divide frequency the / 1831.95: integrand is zero anyway by that time so / 1834.62: you just you don't have to worry about / 1835.91: the cutoff at all at low temperature the / 1837.98: cutoff isn't doing anything so you still / 1839.63: get the T cubed heat capacity which is / 1841.82: what we want but at high temperature at / 1845.33: high temperature we have something / 1847.16: different well ok so let's look at the / 1849.80: Bose factor at high temperature at high / 1853.55: temperature beta H bar Omega is a small / 1855.71: number so we can expand the exponential / 1858.02: so we get 1 plus beta H bar Omega plus / 1861.23: cot minus 1 so the ones cancel we get 1 / 1865.50: over beta H bar Omega or we get the bose / 1868.80: factor is replaced and bose becomes K BT / 1873.44: over H bar Omega so if we then take this / 1878.40: bose factor and plug it into that energy / 1880.53: expression again dropping the zero-point / 1883.53: energy the energy is now integral zero / 1886.50: to sorry to I'll make it to by up to the / 1889.11: cutoff D Omega G Omega then we have H / 1893.01: bar Omega and then we have the Bose / 1894.69: factor which is KB T over H bar Omega / 1897.41: the H bar Omega scan sille and we get / 1900.93: the energy being given by pull out the / 1903.06: KBT and integral 0 to Omega D by D Omega / 1908.66: G Omega and this integral here has been / 1912.63: designed to give us exactly 3 n so we / 1917.19: get the energy in the box is 3 and KBT / 1921.21: or the heat capacity is 3n KB the law of / 1928.29: do long petite so by implementing this / 1931.17: cutoff Debye managed to get the loads / 1934.26: temperatures heat capacity is T cubed / 1936.51: the high temperature heat capacity is / 1938.43: still the law of do long petite so / 1940.86: that's pretty good / 1942.33: let's look at some actual data so this / 1947.22: is the heat capacity of silver over a / 1949.80: broad range of temperature and up at / 1951.84: high temperature you see it's it's / 1953.55: converging to the law of do long petite / 1956.67: and at low temperature it's roughly T / 1959.82: cubed and the Debye Theory agrees with / 1962.52: the experiment extremely extremely well / 1964.80: you can see on the same on the same plot / 1967.05: there's the Einstein theory which fits / 1968.88: pretty good but not quite as well as to / 1971.07: by particularly at low temperature and / 1972.66: but on additional really important / 1975.45: improvement from Einstein to Dubai is / 1977.97: that Debye has no free parameters that / 1980.58: everything is fixed in the Debye theory / 1982.56: by just the velocity of sound of the / 1984.51: density so there's no no you can't muck / 1986.73: around you can't adjust things it just / 1988.38: fits by itself so it's a really good / 1990.21: result and it seems to agree extremely / 1992.52: well with the experiment but we still / 1995.34: have problem it's still wrong or still / 1998.10: Wow / 1998.90: things that are still wrong one is the / 2002.35: cutoff he's really ad hoc cutoff ad hoc / 2005.53: we just sort of made this up I mean it / 2008.20: was a motivated it was a motivated thing / 2011.35: to do it was an intelligent thing to do / 2012.82: but we didn't it wasn't really justified / 2014.59: another thing that's kind of wrong is / 2017.44: that we used Omega proportional to wave / 2022.87: vector the sound law here the frequency / 2026.32: will be proportional to wave vector but / 2028.54: we use this at high K and that's not / 2033.31: true / 2033.88: sound is a small K a long wavelength / 2036.28: phenomenon when you go to very small / 2038.46: wavelengths or very high wave vector / 2040.66: this is no longer true so this was sort / 2044.08: of a problem that we brushed under the / 2045.40: rug / 2045.91: but and incidentally the the wavelengths / 2048.10: we're talking about when you get up near / 2049.90: the Debye frequency the wavelengths are / 2051.73: close to the inter atomic spacing so / 2053.71: we're talking about really really small / 2054.94: wavelengths or really high wave vectors / 2057.25: and we can't really think about sound in / 2058.96: that regime anymore so this is sort of a / 2061.78: problem we brushed under the rug another / 2064.24: thing is that Debye is not exact it's / 2067.96: not exact for any material although it's / 2070.78: pretty good as is obvious from that plot / 2072.85: and third or fourth metals are different / 2077.82: metals are different well for metals we / 2081.64: have this for metals as I mentioned last / 2088.21: time we have low temperature specific / 2090.31: heat see proportional to alpha t cubed / 2094.60: plus gamma T where alpha is predicted by / 2098.17: Debye so if you did the Debye Theory you / 2101.29: would get the coefficient alpha correct / 2103.09: but you wouldn't get gamma at all so / 2105.40: this is just a big question right now we / 2107.02: don't know where that's where that's / 2108.58: coming from so we have to figure that / 2111.85: out and in a few lectures time we'll / 2114.28: have a good idea where that's coming / 2116.29: from but for now it's it's a bit of a / 2117.94: mystery now you might say to me at this / 2120.40: point but wait a second isn't silver a / 2122.38: metal shouldn't I see a linear heat / 2125.32: capacity at low temperature / 2126.76: indeed silver is a metal and you should / 2129.07: see a linear heat capacity at low / 2130.69: temperature but you have to look at it / 2132.40: hard to see it so this is blown up the / 2135.37: very very low temperature regime sort of / 2138.34: 1 to 4 or 5 Kelvin or something like / 2140.68: that 1 to 4 Kelvin I guess and what's / 2144.13: plotted here is the heat capacity / 2145.09: divided by the temperature as a function / 2147.28: of temperature squared if it was a / 2149.38: purity cube law then this line would be / 2153.19: a straight line and would intersect zero / 2154.96: it obviously doesn't intersect zero it / 2157.99: intersects a finite intercept which is / 2159.82: in fact gamma so there's a very very / 2162.52: small term gamma this term gamma is / 2164.59: pretty small but it's clearly there you / 2166.96: have to measure pretty carefully to see / 2168.34: it but it's there okay all right so at / 2172.87: this point we've sort of done talking / 2176.05: about vibrations in solids for a little / 2177.82: while we'll come back to them later in / 2179.17: the term when we do a little bit of a / 2180.34: better job trying to understand these / 2182.23: things but for now we've putting this / 2184.99: aside and we're going to switch gears / 2187.30: and start talking about metals because / 2189.88: metals are obviously different in / 2191.47: several ways this is one way that / 2192.97: they're different but they're different / 2194.41: in many other ways as well and this is / 2196.90: something that was this was known to / 2198.46: known to the ancients even you know / 2200.74: probably in caveman days they they knew / 2202.69: that there were some materials they / 2203.80: found on the ground that just looked / 2204.94: different from other materials and by / 2206.71: 4,000 BC people were able to work with / 2208.87: certain metals things like like copper / 2211.03: and then a couple thousand years later / 2212.35: they were able to work with iron and / 2213.64: each time they were able to command a / 2215.38: particular metal and work with it they / 2217.30: were able to make new things do new / 2218.92: devices new technologies and really / 2221.38: change the history of humankind so you / 2223.66: know starting with metal plows metal / 2226.21: swords metal armor metal warfare of all / 2228.61: sorts / 2229.18: then later on metal machines you have / 2231.58: metal skyscrapers you know the nuclear / 2233.80: age was brought in by you know heavy / 2235.45: metals and heavy metal music very / 2238.03: important also / 2239.58: but metals you know the history of / 2241.75: metals in some way traces the history of / 2244.26: mankind and you know it wasn't until / 2247.66: really the late 1800s that anyone had / 2249.67: the remotest idea what causes metals to / 2252.28: be different and really in 2000's before / 2255.64: we really understood the properties of / 2257.47: metals you have to remember you know for / 2259.27: us the the defining property of a metal / 2261.61: is going to be that it conducts / 2263.08: electricity and nonmetals don't but / 2266.15: we didn't even know what what / 2267.29: electricity was until the late 1800s it / 2269.33: was 1897 before JJ Thompson discovered / 2272.63: the electron or what he called the small / 2275.03: corpuscle of charge that can move around / 2276.83: freely in the metals and could be / 2278.87: ejected out of the metal by a / 2280.43: sufficiently high voltage and with this / 2284.48: picture of the metal really being sort / 2286.85: of a container for all these electrons / 2288.44: running around there became a natural / 2290.42: thing for people to do which was to / 2292.37: consider these electrons running around / 2293.78: as a gas a gas of electrons and this is / 2296.72: what Paul's Ruda did was known as Judah / 2300.05: theory of metals of metals well Arjuna / 2304.28: theory of transport applies to metals / 2306.38: and it's actually particularly good it / 2307.79: works this Drude a theory it's a very / 2309.65: crude classical kinetic theory kinetic / 2314.66: theory of electrons of electrons very / 2320.51: much like the kinetic theory of gases / 2322.28: that you studied last year in your / 2324.32: thermal physics course it works / 2326.57: extremely well despite the fact that is / 2328.70: very crude it works extremely well for a / 2330.26: lot of things particularly well for / 2331.91: semiconductors and so we're going to / 2333.80: attack you know electron transport in in / 2338.00: metals using this beauty Theory first / 2340.25: and then we'll improve on it later so as / 2343.37: with your last year's kinetic theory we / 2346.70: have a couple of assumptions assume in / 2351.26: order to get kinetic theory going one / 2353.30: there's a scattering time scattering / 2357.89: time tau should look familiar from last / 2361.73: year by which we mean that the / 2364.04: probability of scattering probability of / 2366.14: scat in time T or in time DT is equal to / 2373.69: DT over tau now this probably looks / 2377.06: familiar from last year when you did / 2378.41: kinetic theory of gases last year we / 2381.26: need to connect their gases you can even / 2382.70: predict what the scattering time tau is / 2385.07: based on the size of the atoms and how / 2387.11: fast they're moving and things like that / 2388.64: this year we're not going to be so lucky / 2390.50: for a couple reasons first of all it / 2393.26: isn't clear what the scattering / 2394.76: cross-section of the electron should be / 2396.32: because the electrons interact with / 2398.03: things via a long-range colon / 2399.65: so they could they could scatter from / 2401.42: things very far away potentially another / 2403.55: thing that's going to make it difficult / 2405.05: to figure out what Tao is is that the / 2406.79: electron can scatter off of lots of / 2408.26: other things besides just other / 2409.58: electrons it can scatter off of protons / 2411.77: it can scatter off of impurities it can / 2413.42: scatter off of anything in it happens to / 2415.94: be in the metal so for us this / 2418.10: scattering time tau is just gonna be a / 2419.84: phenomenological parameter the second / 2422.78: thing we're going to assume is after / 2425.33: scattering after a scattering event / 2427.85: after scatter we will set the final / 2432.29: momentum equal to zero so you imagine / 2435.59: something you know something moving / 2437.24: along it scatters and then it's final / 2439.07: momentum is zero now that's not right / 2441.08: generally when something scatters its / 2443.03: final momentum goes off randomly in some / 2444.92: random direction but on average as a / 2448.34: vector the average of the vector after / 2450.59: the scattering is pretty close to zero / 2452.06: because it can go off in any possible / 2454.04: direction and that's going to be good / 2455.57: enough for us to be able to make / 2457.55: progress the Third Point which you / 2460.91: probably didn't have last year is that / 2462.77: between scattering events between / 2464.39: scatters the electron should see sees E / 2473.92: and B field if they happen to be there / 2477.86: so if you're applying an electric field / 2479.87: to your metal the electron will / 2481.34: accelerate due to the electric field or / 2483.02: it will curve due to the magnetic field / 2484.49: which seems rather natural just like the / 2486.68: electron we're living in a vacuum okay / 2489.16: so given these three assumptions we can / 2493.22: imagine that we start with an electron / 2495.68: that has momentum P at time T so P of T / 2498.53: is momentum well okay that's obvious at / 2500.75: time T time T and then we'd like to / 2506.87: calculate what is the momentum at time T / 2510.26: plus DT I mean in some ways we're asking / 2513.17: what's the expectation of the momentum / 2515.15: at time T plus DT but we'll treat it as / 2517.64: the actual momentum at time T plus DT / 2520.84: well there's two things that can happen / 2522.95: in between time T and time T plus DT / 2525.62: with probably one minus DT over tau this / 2530.15: is the probability this is probability / 2531.80: of knots / 2532.49: chattering prob of not scattering not / 2535.76: scattering if it does not scatter then / 2539.12: what happens well then it has the / 2541.13: regional momentum plus whatever force is / 2544.31: applied to it times DT and that's just / 2547.28: okay this is just saying that DP DT if / 2551.21: it doesn't scatter is F Newton's law / 2555.13: good but in addition to this there's / 2559.22: also the probability a probability DT / 2562.10: over T that it does scatter and if it / 2564.53: does scatter we give it momentum zero / 2568.09: okay so this is the probability of not / 2571.73: scattering it accelerates as usual due / 2574.07: to the force applied to it and if it / 2575.96: does scatter we give it momentum zero / 2578.21: after the scattering okay then we can do / 2580.64: a little bit of rearrangement here well / 2582.53: actually maybe let's multiply this out / 2583.79: first so this is then P of T plus F DT / 2590.68: minus P over tau and then there's DT and / 2596.95: then there's plus order DT squared and / 2600.79: with a little bit of rearrangement we / 2603.11: can write DP DT which should be P at T / 2609.68: plus DT minus P of T over DT yell at me / 2617.81: if I start writing incomprehensibly you / 2619.91: know if it really gets too painful and / 2622.09: just doing a little bit of a / 2623.72: rearrangement on that equation up there / 2625.22: and putting together this combination we / 2627.98: get F minus P over tau so let me rewrite / 2632.63: this because this is an important / 2634.28: equation DP DT equals force minus T over / 2641.30: tau this is known as the Drude a / 2643.16: transport equation juda and what force / 2648.05: are you supposed to use in it well the / 2649.91: force is the usual Lorentz force force / 2651.95: is a minus e E Plus V cross B / 2657.85: so whatever force the electron feels / 2660.22: goes into that that equation so this / 2664.00: looks a lot like Newton's equation DP DT / 2666.64: equals F is Newton's equation but we / 2668.14: have this additional term on the right / 2670.15: hand side which looks like a drag force / 2672.01: it's a force going in the opposite / 2673.90: direction from its current momentum so / 2676.63: whichever direction is going the force / 2677.92: is pulling in the opposite direction so / 2680.26: let's actually do a really quick / 2682.00: calculation here let's consider consider / 2685.21: the case where there's no no electric or / 2690.67: magnetic fields in your system so you're / 2692.92: not applying any electric or magnetic / 2694.09: field then you just have DP DT is minus / 2699.24: P over tau which you can solve by saying / 2703.78: P of T is some peanuts some initial / 2706.75: momentum e to the minus T over tau so / 2710.98: that tells us that the momentum if I / 2713.86: have an electron moving along with some / 2715.45: initial momentum this scattering term / 2717.97: here slows it down exponentially to zero / 2721.38: momentum with a time scale tau so it's / 2725.20: like a drag so that the idea of the dru / 2727.63: to theory is that you treat scattering / 2729.55: as a drag force that tries to slow / 2731.41: everything down or hinder it's it's / 2733.51: motion and I guess we will stop there / 2735.46: and we'll pick up withdrew the theory / 2736.51: next time I'll see you tomorrow / 2740.15: [Applause]\""

       "\"0.03: okay this is the second lecture of the \\n 2.04: condensed matter course welcome back \\n 3.92: three quick things before we start a \\n 6.15: bunch of people after the first lecture \\n 7.56: asked me what's the title of the book so \\n 9.42: they can find it in the bookstore \\n 10.53: it's the Oxford solid state basics now \\n 12.06: you can find it the second thing I want \\n 15.09: to encourage you to use the message \\n 17.07: board no one's used it yet someone be \\n 19.23: brave post the first message once you \\n 20.88: get going I promise you'll find it \\n 22.17: useful the third thing I didn't \\n 23.79: emphasize this enough last time if \\n 25.38: there's any problems with the course any \\n 27.33: sort of error typos and the homework \\n 29.43: sets typos in the book anything I say if \\n 31.80: it seems wrong in lecture please come to \\n 33.57: me immediately and I can issue \\n 35.25: corrections and therefore not get \\n 36.96: everyone is you know it confused as much \\n 38.58: as we can so just you know either post a \\n 40.68: message on the message boards and the \\n 42.06: email catch me after lecture or you know \\n 44.52: I know it's crazy but you can call me \\n 45.93: maybe yeah anyway so last time we we \\n 53.55: left off we were talking about heat \\n 54.75: capacity of solids and we started with \\n 63.48: the Boltzmann picture of a solid and \\n 65.84: Boltzmann's picture both months picture \\n 70.11: was that an atom in a solid should be \\n 72.00: thought of as sitting in the bottom of a \\n 73.65: harmonic oscillator oscillating back and \\n 75.15: forth and from that picture he was able \\n 77.73: to derive the law of do long petit heat \\n 80.73: capacity per atom is three KB it's \\n 83.58: pretty good result except it didn't \\n 85.53: agree at low temperature where the heat \\n 86.88: capacity of solids drops Einstein \\n 89.40: figured out what was going on he added \\n 92.49: quantum mechanics and due to quantum \\n 95.22: mechanics the energy levels of the \\n 97.53: harmonic oscillator to get quantized and \\n 99.27: when the temperature drops below the \\n 101.46: quantization energy the oscillator gets \\n 103.80: frozen his ground state and the heat \\n 105.36: capacity drops sea drops at low \\n 108.27: temperature drops at low T and his \\n 113.10: prediction was it should drop \\n 114.99: exponentially exponentially his theory \\n 121.41: of heat capacity fit the data pretty \\n 123.27: well and indeed it predicted this drop \\n 125.73: of heat capacity at low temperature but \\n 127.80: unfortunately experiment said experiment \\n 132.14: said that at low temperature the heat \\n 134.31: capacities are proportional to T cubed \\n 136.29: not dropping exponentially so that \\n 140.01: brings us to the subject of today which \\n 142.38: is the Debye theory if I was 1912 and \\n 146.40: the devised intuition was that you \\n 149.25: cannot think of a solid as a bunch of \\n 151.59: atoms in the bottom of our heart \\n 153.12: harmonic well because when one atom \\n 155.22: moves it does get pushed back to its \\n 157.11: original position by its neighbor but in \\n 158.94: the process it pushes its neighbor and \\n 160.38: then his neighbors pushes its neighbor \\n 161.49: and so forth and so on so in fact what \\n 164.37: we should be thinking about is the \\n 166.02: vibration in a solid is actually a wave \\n 171.56: and in particular vibrational waves are \\n 175.14: sound now something was already known \\n 179.91: about how waves behave under the \\n 182.70: influence of quantum mechanics all the \\n 184.47: way back in 1899 Max Planck had done \\n 187.08: this black body radiation calculation \\n 188.94: and when when Max Planck did this \\n 190.32: calculation he actually had no idea what \\n 192.00: he was doing he didn't even like what he \\n 193.53: was doing he said it was a act of \\n 195.15: complete despair never really liked the \\n 197.16: calculation very much but thirteen years \\n 199.20: later people started to understand \\n 200.88: little bits and pieces about quantum \\n 202.20: mechanics and plunks original \\n 204.21: calculations seem to make a lot more \\n 206.34: sense \\n 206.97: so Debye thought that what we should do \\n 208.74: is we should quantize the sound waves \\n 210.75: just like light like light the general \\n 218.91: idea is you know this is in modern \\n 221.82: language you know plunk didn't \\n 223.14: understand this but but we understand \\n 224.70: this now is from Einsteins work we know \\n 227.19: that the energy of a given oscillator \\n 229.53: would be H bar Omega times the bose \\n 233.76: factor beta H bar Omega plus the zero \\n 237.03: point energy plus one half and so if we \\n 240.69: have the the picture that the you know \\n 243.36: of we interpret Planck as now and with \\n 245.43: Debye understood is that each wave mode \\n 248.85: in a box in a Menelik you put your \\n 251.16: material in a box \\n 251.94: each wave mode in that box should be \\n 253.59: treated as an oscillator so the total \\n 256.53: energy e total inside your box is the \\n 260.40: sum over all wave modes \\n 262.65: of h-bar Omega for that mode times Lois \\n 267.84: factor beta H bar Omega for the mode \\n 271.16: mode plus one half and all you have to \\n 274.80: do is sum over all the modes in the box \\n 276.99: now the reason this is going to give you \\n 278.70: something different from what Einstein \\n 279.96: had was because whenever you have a \\n 282.72: bunch of modes in the box some of those \\n 284.16: modes are going to be low temperature \\n 286.53: low energy modes or low frequency modes \\n 288.39: so in Einstein's calculation when the \\n 291.57: temperature dropped below the frequency \\n 293.70: of the oscillator then the heat capacity \\n 296.28: dropped but the idea here is we have a \\n 298.08: whole distribution of frequencies in the \\n 299.91: modes in our box and so as we lower the \\n 301.86: temperature there will always be some \\n 304.83: modes of low enough frequency that will \\n 306.57: still have some heat capacity left so \\n 308.91: the heat capacity won't drop \\n 310.11: exponentially as we go to low \\n 312.66: temperature so that's the intuition now \\n 315.27: there's going to be some differences \\n 316.71: between what clock did and what Debye \\n 320.10: did because light is obviously different \\n 322.83: from sound in many ways one way is that \\n 324.84: light is of course a lot faster than \\n 326.46: sound \\n 326.91: but that's only sort of a quantitative \\n 329.73: difference there's some more qualitative \\n 331.89: differences that we're going to have to \\n 333.06: deal with and one in particular \\n 335.04: light versus sound is that light has two \\n 341.43: polarizations of polarizations and sound \\n 346.71: has three polarizations now you'll \\n 352.11: remember from your enm that if a light \\n 354.90: wave is or an electromagnetic wave of \\n 356.67: any sort is going in the x direction the \\n 358.89: electric field has to be in the Y \\n 361.11: direction or the Z direction it can't be \\n 363.18: in the X direction sound is not like \\n 365.64: that if a sound wave is going in the X \\n 367.47: direction the polarization of the sound \\n 369.78: wave can be in any direction let me show \\n 371.43: you it's probably easiest to explain \\n 372.60: this with a movie so let me show you the \\n 375.54: movie of what I mean by this this is \\n 377.94: what's known as a longitudinal wave \\n 380.12: which means that the atoms are moving \\n 382.92: back and forth in the same direction \\n 384.90: that the wave is actually going so the \\n 387.57: wave is going the X direction and the \\n 389.49: atoms are moving back and forth in the X \\n 391.68: direction so this doesn't occur for \\n 394.71: light for light \\n 396.51: the wave is going the x-direction the \\n 398.07: electromagnetic field is always pointing \\n 400.02: in the y direction of the z direction \\n 400.94: more similar to light is what's known as \\n 403.35: a transverse wave where the light is \\n 406.29: good where the wave is going in the X \\n 408.30: direction but the atoms are actually \\n 410.16: moving back and forth in the Y direction \\n 412.77: or the Z direction okay so with sound \\n 415.68: you can actually have three \\n 416.76: polarizations the atoms can be moving in \\n 418.44: any direction whereas in light the \\n 420.84: electric field has to point in only two \\n 422.49: possible directions is that clear yeah \\n 425.19: okay good so we're gonna have to keep \\n 428.67: track of the fact that we have three \\n 430.89: polarizations for light and only two for \\n 434.37: sap the other way around \\n 435.51: three polarization for sound and only \\n 437.34: two for light there's a couple of things \\n 439.41: we're going to also do which are going \\n 441.36: to be approximations which are going to \\n 443.70: make our life simpler one is that we're \\n 445.95: going to assume the velocity of sound V \\n 450.81: sound is independent of polarization in \\n 453.90: depth of pull this is not actually true \\n 459.81: in reality almost always the transverse \\n 462.57: mode is slower it has a lower velocity \\n 465.21: than the longitudinal mode but it's \\n 468.84: actually not so much more complicated to \\n 470.85: treat this properly but you don't learn \\n 472.71: a whole lot more from doing it more \\n 474.48: properly I think there's an exercise in \\n 476.07: the book that asks you to do it more \\n 477.27: properly but we're just going to assume \\n 478.77: all sound waves have the same same \\n 480.84: velocity independent of whether they're \\n 482.54: longitudinal or transverse as long as \\n 486.39: we're assuming things which are not \\n 488.13: really correct we might as well assume V \\n 490.98: sound is independent of direction of \\n 494.45: direction which is often not true also \\n 498.14: frequently when you have a real solid \\n 500.16: the speed of sound depends on which \\n 502.23: direction the solid you're going we'll \\n 504.21: discuss that a little bit more later on \\n 505.83: in the term but again it's something \\n 508.92: that if you treat it more properly it's \\n 510.21: not that much harder and you don't learn \\n 511.92: so much more from doing it so we're not \\n 513.60: going to to do it more properly but just \\n 516.81: keep in mind that we are making these \\n 518.37: approximations now if you remember back \\n 520.47: to plunks calculation which you did last \\n 524.10: year the first thing you had to worry \\n 526.17: about was counting all of the modes in a \\n 528.66: box does that sound familiar \\n 530.37: a little bit familiar we're gonna go \\n 532.02: through that again because it's \\n 533.19: important and we're gonna use a lot of \\n 534.75: the a lot of the mechanism is to do many \\n 537.93: other things this year so it's worth \\n 539.19: going through so this is a little aside \\n 542.46: on counting waves in a box counting \\n 544.89: waves modes I guess modes in box so it \\n 553.17: starts start with a one dimensional box \\n 554.85: 1d box so let's draw the one dimensional \\n 558.09: box here it is it has some length L we \\n 562.80: can write down a wave in that box with \\n 566.28: hard wall boundary conditions and PI x \\n 569.01: over L as you know comes to zero at both \\n 572.46: ends because of the hard wall boundary \\n 573.87: conditions and this is a perfectly good \\n 575.64: way to write down the waves in the box \\n 577.50: for every different positive integer n \\n 579.15: you have a different wave mode that's \\n 581.52: okay but it's not not what we're gonna \\n 582.84: do what we're gonna do is instead we're \\n 587.19: going to use what's known as periodic \\n 589.65: boundary conditions you may have \\n 590.97: discussed this last year periodic \\n 593.43: boundary conditions boundaries also \\n 597.57: known as born von-karman boundary \\n 599.64: conditions born von Karman Carmen Carmen \\n 605.42: born was one of the Max born was one of \\n 608.58: the creators of quantum mechanics and \\n 611.19: Theodore von Karman was a very important \\n 613.95: mathematician Max Born is also very \\n 615.66: significant because he was Olivia \\n 617.07: newton-john's grandfather she's an \\n 618.60: important pop star if you don't know her \\n 620.13: she was important for my generation at \\n 621.99: any rate so anyway people don't see me \\n 625.80: sufficiently impressed by that statement \\n 627.75: it's it's actually it's it's anyway okay \\n 630.03: so the idea of a periodic boundary \\n 631.53: condition is we're going to take our box \\n 632.76: of length L and we're going to wrap it \\n 634.62: up into a circle of circumference L then \\n 639.87: we're gonna measure X going around the \\n 641.52: box in this way like that and the reason \\n 644.61: we're doing this is because once we do \\n 646.92: this the waves can take the form e to \\n 649.56: the ikx we don't have to work with sines \\n 652.23: and cosines if we have a periodic box in \\n 655.23: a circle we can use Exponential's and if \\n 657.72: you haven't learned already by this time \\n 659.64: in your career Exponential's are just a \\n 661.44: lot easier to work with the \\n 663.24: signs and co-signs now when we write a \\n 665.82: wave e to the ikx we have to be a little \\n 669.09: bit careful because the coordinate X and \\n 672.51: the coordinate X plus L are actually the \\n 675.99: same coordinate if you go a distance L \\n 678.18: around the the box and get back to \\n 680.61: exactly the same point so this wave form \\n 683.43: must be exactly the same whether we plug \\n 685.89: in X or X plus L so we better have you \\n 690.57: know if this is going to make sense we \\n 691.71: better have e to the ikx equal to e to \\n 694.56: the I K X plus L okay or otherwise into \\n 700.35: the I KL has to equal 1 or K has to be 2 \\n 705.57: PI over L times an integer N and that \\n 709.32: integer can be positive or negative or \\n 711.09: is whatever we like ok everyone happy \\n 715.08: with that so far so good \\n 717.21: ok so this means that the spacing \\n 719.46: between allowed between between allowed \\n 725.43: allowed Ches Ches is 2 PI over L ll \\n 732.75: being the circumference of our loop and \\n 735.36: in particular if we ever have to sum \\n 737.88: over all the k's we can replace that sum \\n 740.88: by an integral decay times a factor of L \\n 744.54: over 2 pi did you go through this \\n 747.36: argument last year \\n 748.32: a little bit yes well ok we're going to \\n 751.29: use it an awful lot this year so that's \\n 753.33: why I'm going through it again because \\n 754.65: it's important now we of course don't \\n 759.18: live in one dimension so we have to \\n 761.70: think as multi-dimensional people we \\n 763.74: have to think in multiple dimensions so \\n 766.11: in 3d we're going to take an L by L by L \\n 770.19: periodic box periodic box and at this \\n 776.13: point you might start to be a little bit \\n 778.14: upset because there's no such thing as \\n 780.51: an L by L by L periodic box in the real \\n 783.39: world you would have to have a box for \\n 785.82: which if you went a distance L in any \\n 787.98: direction you came back to exactly where \\n 789.66: you started in three dimensions you \\n 791.28: can't build such a thing they just don't \\n 792.87: exist so why is it we're going to do \\n 794.94: this though the point is you \\n 796.87: doesn't actually matter what you do with \\n 798.58: the boundaries of your system for almost \\n 800.83: any quantity you're actually interested \\n 802.72: in calculating such as the heat capacity \\n 804.82: it's something that you could measure \\n 806.11: locally just in a small region of the \\n 808.75: actual physical system so it doesn't \\n 810.79: matter what you would do with the \\n 811.69: boundaries which could be very very far \\n 813.31: away so you can use hard wall boundary \\n 815.83: conditions you can use periodic boundary \\n 817.21: conditions you can use any other type of \\n 818.77: boundary condition which is convenient \\n 820.54: and for us it's convenient to use these \\n 822.46: periodic boundary conditions and we're \\n 824.20: going to get away with it the reason we \\n 826.18: want to use these periodic boundary \\n 827.35: conditions is because then the waves \\n 828.73: will look like a TVI cave vector dot X \\n 831.67: vector it's an exponential Exponential's \\n 834.49: are easy to work with and that's why \\n 836.23: we're doing it everyone that's still \\n 838.00: happy with that okay good so in three \\n 840.91: dimensions K has to be two PI over L \\n 844.66: times integers and x and y and and Z and \\n 848.58: so if we ever have a sum over K vectors \\n 852.97: we can replace that sum with L over 2 PI \\n 856.95: cubed times the integral DK X integral \\n 861.22: DK y integral DK Z or another way that \\n 865.93: we will most usually write this will \\n 867.67: write this as the volume of the system \\n 870.48: times the integral d 3k over 2 PI cubed \\n 876.33: and we'll see this factored volume \\n 879.45: integral D 3k over 2 PI cubed probably \\n 882.91: see it a hundred times this year before \\n 884.53: we're done ok so what we're going to do \\n 887.05: is we're going to use what we just \\n 889.24: learned about counting waves in a box to \\n 891.70: apply to this equation here so there's \\n 893.86: some over modes here I can write sum \\n 896.20: over modes is going to become the sum \\n 899.98: over all possible K vectors for our \\n 902.92: modes but then times a factor of three \\n 905.20: and the factor of three is from the \\n 907.36: three polarizations we can have one \\n 909.01: longitudinal or two transverse \\n 910.51: polarizations and then this sum we're \\n 913.87: going to use this law here to convert it \\n 916.24: into an integral so now we have three \\n 918.82: factor of the volume integral d 3k over \\n 923.35: 2 PI cubed now since we've assumed over \\n 929.83: here \\n 930.82: everything is isotropic you know the way \\n 933.16: it's philosophies are independent of \\n 934.75: direction we can then take this three \\n 937.42: dimensional Cartesian integral and turn \\n 939.73: it into a spherical polar integral so \\n 942.55: that we have three times the volume \\n 944.74: let's pull out the 2 PI cubed here and \\n 948.07: then we have integral 4 PI K squared \\n 953.29: DK from 0 to infinity as this familiar \\n 957.64: the 4 pi is the integral over the \\n 959.05: spherical directions yes 3 aqua polar \\n 962.29: coordinates everyone's happy with that \\n 963.66: finally since we're thinking about sound \\n 966.88: for sound you've probably learned in \\n 968.65: your fluids course last year or last \\n 970.63: less term frequency is proportional to \\n 974.50: the wave vector and the proportionality \\n 976.42: constant is the velocity velocity of the \\n 981.67: sound so let's just change that integral \\n 984.55: into an integral over frequency instead \\n 987.25: of an integral over wave vector so that \\n 989.20: becomes a plus some factors here as pull \\n 991.42: out a 4 pi upstairs we have a 2 pi cube \\n 995.70: downstairs I guess we have velocity cube \\n 999.13: downstairs and then we have an integral \\n 1000.72: 0 to infinity of Omega squared D Omega \\n 1004.44: and I'm going to write that as just \\n 1009.62: defining a quantity G of Omega D Omega 0 \\n 1014.31: to infinity and this G of Omega is just \\n 1019.23: a bunch of those constants I'm going to \\n 1020.55: stick together so I guess I have 12 12 \\n 1023.85: pi upstairs and I have 2 PI cubed \\n 1027.00: downstairs I guess I have a velocity \\n 1029.55: cube downstairs and then I have a volume \\n 1032.79: upstairs and I'm gonna write the volume \\n 1034.59: upstairs in sort of a tricky way I'm \\n 1036.81: gonna write it as the number of atoms \\n 1038.61: divided by the volume downstairs that's \\n 1041.49: the density and then the number of atoms \\n 1043.62: upstairs that's gonna be convenient and \\n 1046.11: then I need also that Omega squared \\n 1049.82: Omega squared so this quantity here is \\n 1053.85: known as which I put it over here G of \\n 1057.99: Omega is known as G of Omega is known as \\n 1061.56: the density of states and \\n 1063.20: think you ran into this last year when \\n 1065.27: you do blackbody radiation the idea of a \\n 1068.90: density of states is that it is \\n 1072.31: basically how many of these modes you \\n 1075.17: have at a given frequency in particular \\n 1077.87: G Omega D Omega equals number of modes \\n 1084.22: with frequency frequency between between \\n 1092.74: Omega and Omega Plus D Omega so if you \\n 1099.23: want to sum over all the modes in the \\n 1101.30: system instead of just summing all the \\n 1103.46: modes what you do is you integrate over \\n 1105.05: all frequencies times the number of \\n 1107.09: modes at each frequency okay sort of a \\n 1109.81: convenient way to do things \\n 1111.89: I'm actually also going to simplify this \\n 1114.89: a little bit further by defining another \\n 1116.98: convenient quantity I'm gonna rewrite \\n 1119.60: this G of Omega G of Omega as I'm gonna \\n 1124.04: write it as pull out the N number of \\n 1126.71: atoms then nine Omega squared over Omega \\n 1131.03: D cubed so I'm defining Omega D cubed \\n 1133.85: here to be a bunch of those constants \\n 1135.86: stuck together Omega D cubed is 6 pi \\n 1139.46: squared times the density number over \\n 1142.70: volume times velocity of sound cubed \\n 1146.92: this is known as the Debye frequency \\n 1149.65: after mr. Debye frequency and at least \\n 1155.51: for now \\n 1156.23: we're just going to think of it as this \\n 1157.70: bunch of constants that we've \\n 1159.23: conveniently defined so it's easier to \\n 1160.82: write G and in a moment we'll give it a \\n 1163.01: more important meaning but for now it's \\n 1164.69: just those bunch of constants okay so \\n 1169.12: having done all of that we can then way \\n 1172.13: up there at the very top of the board we \\n 1173.81: have the expression for the energy as a \\n 1176.36: sum over all of the modes so I'm \\n 1179.54: actually maybe I'll put it over here so \\n 1182.78: I don't have to scroll that off the top \\n 1184.07: of the board \\n 1184.70: so we'll now write the energy the total \\n 1188.51: energy at a given temperature instead of \\n 1191.21: writing it as a sum over all the modes \\n 1193.10: I'm going to write it as an integral \\n 1195.11: over frequencies \\n 1196.67: equals integral D Omega from 0 to \\n 1199.79: infinity G of Omega that's the sum over \\n 1202.10: all modes by integrating over frequency \\n 1204.77: and the thing that we want to integrate \\n 1205.91: is H bar Omega bows factor beta H bar \\n 1209.99: Omega plus 1/2 ok people happy with that \\n 1215.72: what we're doing yes yes maybe yeah ok \\n 1219.65: good \\n 1220.18: all right so this is the expression that \\n 1223.22: we're going to try to evaluate and if \\n 1225.56: you're paying really close attention \\n 1226.51: you'll be upset with me already because \\n 1229.85: it's actually infinite this total energy \\n 1233.36: in the box is infinite and the reason \\n 1235.88: it's infinite is because of this plus \\n 1237.92: 1/2 look at what the plus 1/2 multiplies \\n 1241.52: it multiplies a factor of Omega G of \\n 1243.65: Omega is proportional to Omega squared \\n 1245.51: so it's the integral of Omega cubed from \\n 1247.73: 0 to infinity \\n 1248.78: that's infinite so that's kind of it you \\n 1251.30: might think that's kind of a problem \\n 1252.88: actually it didn't bother to buy or \\n 1254.90: plunk because they didn't know about \\n 1256.10: zero-point energy so they never wrote \\n 1257.57: down this plus 1/2 but it's not gonna \\n 1259.43: bother us either for a number of reasons \\n 1261.14: the main reason it's not going to bother \\n 1262.67: us is because it gives us an infinite \\n 1264.83: quantity but it's an infinite quantity \\n 1267.35: that's independent of temperature the \\n 1269.39: only place in this expression where \\n 1270.95: temperature occurs is right here at the \\n 1273.08: end of the day we want heat capacity \\n 1275.09: which is the derivative of the energy \\n 1276.32: with respect to temperature so we're \\n 1278.09: gonna have to differentiate this thing \\n 1279.26: with respect to temperature and the 1/2 \\n 1281.75: is going to go away because it's \\n 1282.95: temperature independent so it's giving \\n 1284.30: us an infinite but temperature \\n 1286.10: independent contribution so we don't \\n 1287.72: care about it actually in a few moments \\n 1289.76: we're gonna see another reason why we're \\n 1291.29: not gonna care about that 1/2 but for \\n 1293.51: now we'll just realize it's not going to \\n 1295.70: change our expression for the heat \\n 1297.50: capacity all right so now we can plug in \\n 1301.25: the density of states into this equation \\n 1303.83: here so let's do that so we get 9 and \\n 1306.98: I'll pull out the H bar from over there \\n 1309.17: there's Omega 2 by cubed here cubed \\n 1312.47: downstairs and then the thing we have \\n 1315.05: left to integrate integral D Omega from \\n 1317.75: 0 to infinity \\n 1318.77: there's Omega cubed upstairs and then \\n 1321.35: the bose factor e to the beta H bar \\n 1323.12: Omega minus 1 is left that looks a \\n 1327.02: little bit ugly but we can take this \\n 1329.78: integral \\n 1330.56: we can simplify it a little bit by \\n 1332.12: writing x equals beta H bar Omega and \\n 1335.66: then the integral turns into 1 over beta \\n 1339.05: H bar to the fourth times this integral \\n 1342.95: integral DX from 0 to infinity of X \\n 1346.25: cubed e to the X minus 1 and I promise \\n 1351.14: you no one is ever going to ask you to \\n 1352.76: evaluate this integral it's just some \\n 1354.83: number the number happens to be PI to \\n 1356.81: the fourth over 15 and if you really \\n 1360.17: want to know where that number comes \\n 1361.58: from you it's in the you know appendix \\n 1364.37: of one of the chapters of the book don't \\n 1366.71: you hate it when someone says you can go \\n 1367.91: read the book but in fact it's not so \\n 1369.59: important it just gives us a number the \\n 1370.85: important thing is it gives us some \\n 1372.17: known number so we can put that number \\n 1374.27: in and get the end result that the \\n 1378.17: energy the total energy in the box is 9 \\n 1381.86: and KBT to the fourth I'm here divided \\n 1387.47: by H bar Omega Debye cubed times this \\n 1391.34: factor part of the fourth over 15 ok \\n 1397.01: good and then of course we can \\n 1399.71: differentiate this to get the heat \\n 1401.42: capacity heat capacity is de DT and okay \\n 1407.45: so it's n KB KB T over H bar I'll make \\n 1413.63: it 2 by cubed and then I guess 12 PI to \\n 1418.16: the fourth over 5 what's so that's the \\n 1421.58: heat capacity and so a couple of things \\n 1423.80: to comment about this it makes this \\n 1425.42: exciting first of all it's proportional \\n 1427.55: to T cubed \\n 1428.36: just like the by wanted you get the T \\n 1430.88: cubed dependence of the heat capacity as \\n 1433.43: expected it shouldn't be surprising that \\n 1435.77: you get this T cubed heat capacity \\n 1437.51: because you remember from the blackbody \\n 1439.40: radiation calculation you did last year \\n 1441.89: that the energy of radiation the energy \\n 1444.14: of waves in a box that you calculated is \\n 1446.38: proportional to T to the fourth you \\n 1448.61: should have expected the energy to be T \\n 1450.14: to the fourth and then you differentiate \\n 1451.61: it once and you get T cubed so this is \\n 1453.86: why Debye expected that by treating the \\n 1455.66: waves the same way we treated radiation \\n 1458.05: we would get the T cubed law furthermore \\n 1462.74: there's something really \\n 1464.21: fighting about this formula here and \\n 1465.59: that is that there's no free parameters \\n 1468.47: remember when Einstein did his \\n 1469.79: calculation he had this frequency this \\n 1471.53: Einstein frequency the oscillator \\n 1473.18: frequency which he didn't know how to \\n 1475.70: come up with this frequency he just fit \\n 1477.44: it to the experiment to try to make it \\n 1478.85: all look nice here there's no free \\n 1480.80: parameter Omega Debye here is fixed by \\n 1484.52: the density and the sound velocity so \\n 1487.22: everything is fixed here and if and if \\n 1488.72: you calculate this quantity and you \\n 1490.88: compare it to low temperature heat \\n 1492.17: capacity of most materials it actually \\n 1494.75: actually agrees extremely well but \\n 1498.05: unfortunately like you know you never \\n 1500.48: get anything for free so we still have a \\n 1503.45: problem problem at high T we want the \\n 1512.30: law of do long petite C over N is 3 KB \\n 1515.57: and we didn't get that we got T cubed at \\n 1518.42: all temperatures here and this is where \\n 1520.49: the BI had to actually scratch his head \\n 1522.50: a little bit and think ok what did I do \\n 1524.39: wrong \\n 1525.40: incidentally if you do this calculation \\n 1527.18: for electromagnetic radiation it really \\n 1530.30: is T to the fourth energy all the way up \\n 1532.88: to arbitrarily high temperature where as \\n 1535.34: you know in a solid we know that the \\n 1537.38: heat capacity the solid at some high \\n 1539.27: temperature is going to give us just \\n 1540.50: three KB it's not going to be T cubed so \\n 1544.60: here we have to deviate from plunks \\n 1547.22: calculation we have to do something \\n 1548.39: different from what it was that plunk \\n 1551.03: did and plunk and Debye understood that \\n 1555.11: where he was going wrong where he was \\n 1557.57: going wrong you know he has to think \\n 1559.31: about where this three comes from where \\n 1560.87: is this three from the three comes from \\n 1562.82: the fact that the atom can move in three \\n 1565.34: directions each atom moves in three \\n 1567.68: possible directions you can figure this \\n 1568.94: three degrees of freedom that the atom \\n 1571.64: has and how many degrees of freedom did \\n 1574.55: he count in his box well the total \\n 1577.76: number of modes number of modes that he \\n 1579.86: counted his integral from 0 to infinity \\n 1583.01: G Omega D Omega and G of Omega goes as \\n 1586.88: Omega squared you integrate that into \\n 1588.38: infinity and that gives you infinity so \\n 1591.29: he counted an infinite number of degrees \\n 1593.00: of freedom and he said well wait I'm I \\n 1595.34: counted an infinite number of modes in \\n 1597.05: the box but there's a fine \\n 1598.10: of degrees of freedom each atom can move \\n 1600.26: in three directions and there shouldn't \\n 1601.91: be more than that many degrees of \\n 1603.32: freedom in my box so somehow I have to \\n 1605.69: fix that problem and make the Box have \\n 1608.18: only a fixed number of degrees of \\n 1609.98: freedom not an infinite number of \\n 1611.33: degrees of freedom so how did he do that \\n 1613.51: impose a cutoff so what he's going to do \\n 1619.43: is he's going to declare some frequency \\n 1622.37: cutoff Omega cutoff G Omega D Omega such \\n 1629.78: that there are exactly three n modes in \\n 1632.54: the box now this is an ad-hoc solution \\n 1636.17: and it's kind of a little weird so what \\n 1639.23: he's doing is he's saying we have all \\n 1641.00: these wave modes in a box and when you \\n 1642.71: get to Psalm a frequency known as the \\n 1644.99: cutoff frequency above that there are no \\n 1647.39: more wave modes left you have no sound \\n 1649.22: moves above this above this frequency \\n 1650.96: anymore seems a little strange later in \\n 1653.15: the term we're going to see it's maybe \\n 1654.14: not as strange as we thought but at then \\n 1656.48: at that time maybe it seemed a little \\n 1658.10: odd but he's gonna do it anyway so we're \\n 1659.87: gonna do this anyway we're gonna follow \\n 1660.95: him and see what happens first thing we \\n 1663.89: need to do is we have to figure out what \\n 1664.94: this cutoff frequency is going to be \\n 1666.86: such it's going to give us exactly three \\n 1669.68: n modes so let's calculate this thing \\n 1671.86: well plug in G Omega so plug in G of \\n 1675.92: Omega here so there's a nine and there's \\n 1678.47: Omega two by cubed integral 0 to Omega \\n 1681.62: cutoff Omega squared D Omega so I just \\n 1686.54: plugged in G of Omega there and then \\n 1688.61: let's do that integral and we get three \\n 1691.40: n Omega cutoff cubed over Omega D I \\n 1696.59: cubed by cubed and we want this to equal \\n 1701.06: three N and in order for that to be true \\n 1703.91: we better choose Omega cutoff equal to \\n 1708.86: Omega 2 bi okay that's why I happen to \\n 1713.30: choose those particular constants as \\n 1715.94: being Omega 2 by Omega 2 by is the \\n 1718.64: cutoff frequency if you cut off your \\n 1720.53: Moser at the Debye frequency you only \\n 1722.72: count modes at lower frequencies in the \\n 1724.85: Debye frequency you have exactly 3n \\n 1726.83: modes okay all right so now we're going \\n 1731.33: to go back to the \\n 1732.02: equation over here and we're going to \\n 1734.45: rewrite the total energy in the box now \\n 1736.82: as the integral counting up modes not to \\n 1741.65: infinity now I'm only up to Omega 2 by G \\n 1745.01: Omega and then the bose factor beta H \\n 1748.67: bar Omega and then plus 1/2 zero-point \\n 1752.12: energy and you'll notice now because \\n 1754.49: we've cut off our number of modes this \\n 1757.13: term no longer diverges it's a finite \\n 1759.34: zero-point energy term and that makes us \\n 1761.69: a little bit happier but again we can \\n 1764.33: actually ignore it \\n 1765.77: drop this because it's temperature \\n 1769.34: independent it's a temperature \\n 1770.63: independent zero-point energy we're \\n 1772.55: going to differentiate the thing anyway \\n 1773.93: so we don't really care about it it's \\n 1775.70: just going to give us some overall \\n 1776.66: constant shift in the energy which isn't \\n 1779.27: very interesting so we're going to drop \\n 1780.71: that anyway ok and then this expression \\n 1783.98: should give us the energy in the box or \\n 1785.63: the heat capacity in the box once we \\n 1786.86: differentiate it at any temperature we \\n 1788.63: choose just by plugging the temperature \\n 1790.52: in here but it's useful to look at \\n 1793.34: various limits so the first limit is low \\n 1795.98: temperature limit and by that I mean KBT \\n 1799.69: much less than h-bar omega Debye and in \\n 1803.72: this limit we get the same result same \\n 1806.39: result as we had before this result here \\n 1810.44: exactly this nothing changes why is that \\n 1813.62: well the reason nothing changes is \\n 1816.17: because at low temperature this bose \\n 1818.60: factor vanishes very quickly with \\n 1821.15: frequency by the time you're up near the \\n 1823.55: Debye frequency the bose factor is \\n 1825.59: essentially zero anyway so it doesn't \\n 1827.33: matter if you cut it off at the Debye \\n 1828.65: frequency or twice the Debye frequency \\n 1829.97: or half the divide frequency the \\n 1831.95: integrand is zero anyway by that time so \\n 1834.62: you just you don't have to worry about \\n 1835.91: the cutoff at all at low temperature the \\n 1837.98: cutoff isn't doing anything so you still \\n 1839.63: get the T cubed heat capacity which is \\n 1841.82: what we want but at high temperature at \\n 1845.33: high temperature we have something \\n 1847.16: different well ok so let's look at the \\n 1849.80: Bose factor at high temperature at high \\n 1853.55: temperature beta H bar Omega is a small \\n 1855.71: number so we can expand the exponential \\n 1858.02: so we get 1 plus beta H bar Omega plus \\n 1861.23: cot minus 1 so the ones cancel we get 1 \\n 1865.50: over beta H bar Omega or we get the bose \\n 1868.80: factor is replaced and bose becomes K BT \\n 1873.44: over H bar Omega so if we then take this \\n 1878.40: bose factor and plug it into that energy \\n 1880.53: expression again dropping the zero-point \\n 1883.53: energy the energy is now integral zero \\n 1886.50: to sorry to I'll make it to by up to the \\n 1889.11: cutoff D Omega G Omega then we have H \\n 1893.01: bar Omega and then we have the Bose \\n 1894.69: factor which is KB T over H bar Omega \\n 1897.41: the H bar Omega scan sille and we get \\n 1900.93: the energy being given by pull out the \\n 1903.06: KBT and integral 0 to Omega D by D Omega \\n 1908.66: G Omega and this integral here has been \\n 1912.63: designed to give us exactly 3 n so we \\n 1917.19: get the energy in the box is 3 and KBT \\n 1921.21: or the heat capacity is 3n KB the law of \\n 1928.29: do long petite so by implementing this \\n 1931.17: cutoff Debye managed to get the loads \\n 1934.26: temperatures heat capacity is T cubed \\n 1936.51: the high temperature heat capacity is \\n 1938.43: still the law of do long petite so \\n 1940.86: that's pretty good \\n 1942.33: let's look at some actual data so this \\n 1947.22: is the heat capacity of silver over a \\n 1949.80: broad range of temperature and up at \\n 1951.84: high temperature you see it's it's \\n 1953.55: converging to the law of do long petite \\n 1956.67: and at low temperature it's roughly T \\n 1959.82: cubed and the Debye Theory agrees with \\n 1962.52: the experiment extremely extremely well \\n 1964.80: you can see on the same on the same plot \\n 1967.05: there's the Einstein theory which fits \\n 1968.88: pretty good but not quite as well as to \\n 1971.07: by particularly at low temperature and \\n 1972.66: but on additional really important \\n 1975.45: improvement from Einstein to Dubai is \\n 1977.97: that Debye has no free parameters that \\n 1980.58: everything is fixed in the Debye theory \\n 1982.56: by just the velocity of sound of the \\n 1984.51: density so there's no no you can't muck \\n 1986.73: around you can't adjust things it just \\n 1988.38: fits by itself so it's a really good \\n 1990.21: result and it seems to agree extremely \\n 1992.52: well with the experiment but we still \\n 1995.34: have problem it's still wrong or still \\n 1998.10: Wow \\n 1998.90: things that are still wrong one is the \\n 2002.35: cutoff he's really ad hoc cutoff ad hoc \\n 2005.53: we just sort of made this up I mean it \\n 2008.20: was a motivated it was a motivated thing \\n 2011.35: to do it was an intelligent thing to do \\n 2012.82: but we didn't it wasn't really justified \\n 2014.59: another thing that's kind of wrong is \\n 2017.44: that we used Omega proportional to wave \\n 2022.87: vector the sound law here the frequency \\n 2026.32: will be proportional to wave vector but \\n 2028.54: we use this at high K and that's not \\n 2033.31: true \\n 2033.88: sound is a small K a long wavelength \\n 2036.28: phenomenon when you go to very small \\n 2038.46: wavelengths or very high wave vector \\n 2040.66: this is no longer true so this was sort \\n 2044.08: of a problem that we brushed under the \\n 2045.40: rug \\n 2045.91: but and incidentally the the wavelengths \\n 2048.10: we're talking about when you get up near \\n 2049.90: the Debye frequency the wavelengths are \\n 2051.73: close to the inter atomic spacing so \\n 2053.71: we're talking about really really small \\n 2054.94: wavelengths or really high wave vectors \\n 2057.25: and we can't really think about sound in \\n 2058.96: that regime anymore so this is sort of a \\n 2061.78: problem we brushed under the rug another \\n 2064.24: thing is that Debye is not exact it's \\n 2067.96: not exact for any material although it's \\n 2070.78: pretty good as is obvious from that plot \\n 2072.85: and third or fourth metals are different \\n 2077.82: metals are different well for metals we \\n 2081.64: have this for metals as I mentioned last \\n 2088.21: time we have low temperature specific \\n 2090.31: heat see proportional to alpha t cubed \\n 2094.60: plus gamma T where alpha is predicted by \\n 2098.17: Debye so if you did the Debye Theory you \\n 2101.29: would get the coefficient alpha correct \\n 2103.09: but you wouldn't get gamma at all so \\n 2105.40: this is just a big question right now we \\n 2107.02: don't know where that's where that's \\n 2108.58: coming from so we have to figure that \\n 2111.85: out and in a few lectures time we'll \\n 2114.28: have a good idea where that's coming \\n 2116.29: from but for now it's it's a bit of a \\n 2117.94: mystery now you might say to me at this \\n 2120.40: point but wait a second isn't silver a \\n 2122.38: metal shouldn't I see a linear heat \\n 2125.32: capacity at low temperature \\n 2126.76: indeed silver is a metal and you should \\n 2129.07: see a linear heat capacity at low \\n 2130.69: temperature but you have to look at it \\n 2132.40: hard to see it so this is blown up the \\n 2135.37: very very low temperature regime sort of \\n 2138.34: 1 to 4 or 5 Kelvin or something like \\n 2140.68: that 1 to 4 Kelvin I guess and what's \\n 2144.13: plotted here is the heat capacity \\n 2145.09: divided by the temperature as a function \\n 2147.28: of temperature squared if it was a \\n 2149.38: purity cube law then this line would be \\n 2153.19: a straight line and would intersect zero \\n 2154.96: it obviously doesn't intersect zero it \\n 2157.99: intersects a finite intercept which is \\n 2159.82: in fact gamma so there's a very very \\n 2162.52: small term gamma this term gamma is \\n 2164.59: pretty small but it's clearly there you \\n 2166.96: have to measure pretty carefully to see \\n 2168.34: it but it's there okay all right so at \\n 2172.87: this point we've sort of done talking \\n 2176.05: about vibrations in solids for a little \\n 2177.82: while we'll come back to them later in \\n 2179.17: the term when we do a little bit of a \\n 2180.34: better job trying to understand these \\n 2182.23: things but for now we've putting this \\n 2184.99: aside and we're going to switch gears \\n 2187.30: and start talking about metals because \\n 2189.88: metals are obviously different in \\n 2191.47: several ways this is one way that \\n 2192.97: they're different but they're different \\n 2194.41: in many other ways as well and this is \\n 2196.90: something that was this was known to \\n 2198.46: known to the ancients even you know \\n 2200.74: probably in caveman days they they knew \\n 2202.69: that there were some materials they \\n 2203.80: found on the ground that just looked \\n 2204.94: different from other materials and by \\n 2206.71: 4,000 BC people were able to work with \\n 2208.87: certain metals things like like copper \\n 2211.03: and then a couple thousand years later \\n 2212.35: they were able to work with iron and \\n 2213.64: each time they were able to command a \\n 2215.38: particular metal and work with it they \\n 2217.30: were able to make new things do new \\n 2218.92: devices new technologies and really \\n 2221.38: change the history of humankind so you \\n 2223.66: know starting with metal plows metal \\n 2226.21: swords metal armor metal warfare of all \\n 2228.61: sorts \\n 2229.18: then later on metal machines you have \\n 2231.58: metal skyscrapers you know the nuclear \\n 2233.80: age was brought in by you know heavy \\n 2235.45: metals and heavy metal music very \\n 2238.03: important also \\n 2239.58: but metals you know the history of \\n 2241.75: metals in some way traces the history of \\n 2244.26: mankind and you know it wasn't until \\n 2247.66: really the late 1800s that anyone had \\n 2249.67: the remotest idea what causes metals to \\n 2252.28: be different and really in 2000's before \\n 2255.64: we really understood the properties of \\n 2257.47: metals you have to remember you know for \\n 2259.27: us the the defining property of a metal \\n 2261.61: is going to be that it conducts \\n 2263.08: electricity and nonmetals don't but \\n 2266.15: we didn't even know what what \\n 2267.29: electricity was until the late 1800s it \\n 2269.33: was 1897 before JJ Thompson discovered \\n 2272.63: the electron or what he called the small \\n 2275.03: corpuscle of charge that can move around \\n 2276.83: freely in the metals and could be \\n 2278.87: ejected out of the metal by a \\n 2280.43: sufficiently high voltage and with this \\n 2284.48: picture of the metal really being sort \\n 2286.85: of a container for all these electrons \\n 2288.44: running around there became a natural \\n 2290.42: thing for people to do which was to \\n 2292.37: consider these electrons running around \\n 2293.78: as a gas a gas of electrons and this is \\n 2296.72: what Paul's Ruda did was known as Judah \\n 2300.05: theory of metals of metals well Arjuna \\n 2304.28: theory of transport applies to metals \\n 2306.38: and it's actually particularly good it \\n 2307.79: works this Drude a theory it's a very \\n 2309.65: crude classical kinetic theory kinetic \\n 2314.66: theory of electrons of electrons very \\n 2320.51: much like the kinetic theory of gases \\n 2322.28: that you studied last year in your \\n 2324.32: thermal physics course it works \\n 2326.57: extremely well despite the fact that is \\n 2328.70: very crude it works extremely well for a \\n 2330.26: lot of things particularly well for \\n 2331.91: semiconductors and so we're going to \\n 2333.80: attack you know electron transport in in \\n 2338.00: metals using this beauty Theory first \\n 2340.25: and then we'll improve on it later so as \\n 2343.37: with your last year's kinetic theory we \\n 2346.70: have a couple of assumptions assume in \\n 2351.26: order to get kinetic theory going one \\n 2353.30: there's a scattering time scattering \\n 2357.89: time tau should look familiar from last \\n 2361.73: year by which we mean that the \\n 2364.04: probability of scattering probability of \\n 2366.14: scat in time T or in time DT is equal to \\n 2373.69: DT over tau now this probably looks \\n 2377.06: familiar from last year when you did \\n 2378.41: kinetic theory of gases last year we \\n 2381.26: need to connect their gases you can even \\n 2382.70: predict what the scattering time tau is \\n 2385.07: based on the size of the atoms and how \\n 2387.11: fast they're moving and things like that \\n 2388.64: this year we're not going to be so lucky \\n 2390.50: for a couple reasons first of all it \\n 2393.26: isn't clear what the scattering \\n 2394.76: cross-section of the electron should be \\n 2396.32: because the electrons interact with \\n 2398.03: things via a long-range colon \\n 2399.65: so they could they could scatter from \\n 2401.42: things very far away potentially another \\n 2403.55: thing that's going to make it difficult \\n 2405.05: to figure out what Tao is is that the \\n 2406.79: electron can scatter off of lots of \\n 2408.26: other things besides just other \\n 2409.58: electrons it can scatter off of protons \\n 2411.77: it can scatter off of impurities it can \\n 2413.42: scatter off of anything in it happens to \\n 2415.94: be in the metal so for us this \\n 2418.10: scattering time tau is just gonna be a \\n 2419.84: phenomenological parameter the second \\n 2422.78: thing we're going to assume is after \\n 2425.33: scattering after a scattering event \\n 2427.85: after scatter we will set the final \\n 2432.29: momentum equal to zero so you imagine \\n 2435.59: something you know something moving \\n 2437.24: along it scatters and then it's final \\n 2439.07: momentum is zero now that's not right \\n 2441.08: generally when something scatters its \\n 2443.03: final momentum goes off randomly in some \\n 2444.92: random direction but on average as a \\n 2448.34: vector the average of the vector after \\n 2450.59: the scattering is pretty close to zero \\n 2452.06: because it can go off in any possible \\n 2454.04: direction and that's going to be good \\n 2455.57: enough for us to be able to make \\n 2457.55: progress the Third Point which you \\n 2460.91: probably didn't have last year is that \\n 2462.77: between scattering events between \\n 2464.39: scatters the electron should see sees E \\n 2473.92: and B field if they happen to be there \\n 2477.86: so if you're applying an electric field \\n 2479.87: to your metal the electron will \\n 2481.34: accelerate due to the electric field or \\n 2483.02: it will curve due to the magnetic field \\n 2484.49: which seems rather natural just like the \\n 2486.68: electron we're living in a vacuum okay \\n 2489.16: so given these three assumptions we can \\n 2493.22: imagine that we start with an electron \\n 2495.68: that has momentum P at time T so P of T \\n 2498.53: is momentum well okay that's obvious at \\n 2500.75: time T time T and then we'd like to \\n 2506.87: calculate what is the momentum at time T \\n 2510.26: plus DT I mean in some ways we're asking \\n 2513.17: what's the expectation of the momentum \\n 2515.15: at time T plus DT but we'll treat it as \\n 2517.64: the actual momentum at time T plus DT \\n 2520.84: well there's two things that can happen \\n 2522.95: in between time T and time T plus DT \\n 2525.62: with probably one minus DT over tau this \\n 2530.15: is the probability this is probability \\n 2531.80: of knots \\n 2532.49: chattering prob of not scattering not \\n 2535.76: scattering if it does not scatter then \\n 2539.12: what happens well then it has the \\n 2541.13: regional momentum plus whatever force is \\n 2544.31: applied to it times DT and that's just \\n 2547.28: okay this is just saying that DP DT if \\n 2551.21: it doesn't scatter is F Newton's law \\n 2555.13: good but in addition to this there's \\n 2559.22: also the probability a probability DT \\n 2562.10: over T that it does scatter and if it \\n 2564.53: does scatter we give it momentum zero \\n 2568.09: okay so this is the probability of not \\n 2571.73: scattering it accelerates as usual due \\n 2574.07: to the force applied to it and if it \\n 2575.96: does scatter we give it momentum zero \\n 2578.21: after the scattering okay then we can do \\n 2580.64: a little bit of rearrangement here well \\n 2582.53: actually maybe let's multiply this out \\n 2583.79: first so this is then P of T plus F DT \\n 2590.68: minus P over tau and then there's DT and \\n 2596.95: then there's plus order DT squared and \\n 2600.79: with a little bit of rearrangement we \\n 2603.11: can write DP DT which should be P at T \\n 2609.68: plus DT minus P of T over DT yell at me \\n 2617.81: if I start writing incomprehensibly you \\n 2619.91: know if it really gets too painful and \\n 2622.09: just doing a little bit of a \\n 2623.72: rearrangement on that equation up there \\n 2625.22: and putting together this combination we \\n 2627.98: get F minus P over tau so let me rewrite \\n 2632.63: this because this is an important \\n 2634.28: equation DP DT equals force minus T over \\n 2641.30: tau this is known as the Drude a \\n 2643.16: transport equation juda and what force \\n 2648.05: are you supposed to use in it well the \\n 2649.91: force is the usual Lorentz force force \\n 2651.95: is a minus e E Plus V cross B \\n 2657.85: so whatever force the electron feels \\n 2660.22: goes into that that equation so this \\n 2664.00: looks a lot like Newton's equation DP DT \\n 2666.64: equals F is Newton's equation but we \\n 2668.14: have this additional term on the right \\n 2670.15: hand side which looks like a drag force \\n 2672.01: it's a force going in the opposite \\n 2673.90: direction from its current momentum so \\n 2676.63: whichever direction is going the force \\n 2677.92: is pulling in the opposite direction so \\n 2680.26: let's actually do a really quick \\n 2682.00: calculation here let's consider consider \\n 2685.21: the case where there's no no electric or \\n 2690.67: magnetic fields in your system so you're \\n 2692.92: not applying any electric or magnetic \\n 2694.09: field then you just have DP DT is minus \\n 2699.24: P over tau which you can solve by saying \\n 2703.78: P of T is some peanuts some initial \\n 2706.75: momentum e to the minus T over tau so \\n 2710.98: that tells us that the momentum if I \\n 2713.86: have an electron moving along with some \\n 2715.45: initial momentum this scattering term \\n 2717.97: here slows it down exponentially to zero \\n 2721.38: momentum with a time scale tau so it's \\n 2725.20: like a drag so that the idea of the dru \\n 2727.63: to theory is that you treat scattering \\n 2729.55: as a drag force that tries to slow \\n 2731.41: everything down or hinder it's it's \\n 2733.51: motion and I guess we will stop there \\n 2735.46: and we'll pick up withdrew the theory \\n 2736.51: next time I'll see you tomorrow \\n

\\n 80.82: resonates for me on a deep level \\n 82.59: [Music] \\n 85.86: your whole body when you're watching \\n 87.96: them there's nothing quite like it it's \\n 91.02: mesmerizing and euphoric \\n 93.84: it's better than any drug really \\n 96.60: the power and magnificence of their \\n 99.18: music is so breathtaking it seems that \\n 103.26: at any moment they're gonna Elevate \\n 105.48: right off the stage and float away on a \\n 108.24: cloud \\n 109.92: speaking of the weather the day unfolded \\n 112.44: in typical English fashion gray skies \\n 115.20: for most of the afternoon that is until \\n 118.02: slow dive took the stage and almost on \\n 120.60: cue the sun came out for them \\n 123.32: foreign \\n 125.42: had agreed to talk to me after the show \\n 127.98: but of course right after their \\n 129.78: brilliant set it starts pissing down \\n 132.12: rain so I was faced with the Dilemma \\n 134.88: where to film them looking around at the \\n 138.30: backstage area of the Fest there really \\n 141.48: was only one dry spot in the whole place \\n 145.08: it was a small Carriage that was packed \\n 147.90: with people drinking and partying I knew \\n 150.96: my only chance was to make them an offer \\n 153.84: they couldn't refuse two free drinks \\n 156.60: each in exchange for their vacating of \\n 159.54: the carriage so I could speak with slow \\n 161.88: dive luckily they agreed and all it set \\n 165.24: me back was about 100 quid I just added \\n 168.12: it to our budget under miscellaneous \\n 172.00: [Music] \\n 174.60: yeah happiness in a pipe he loved Rides \\n 179.46: Away on his silver bike and apart from \\n 184.08: that he would be so kind in consenting \\n 188.76: to blur your mind \\n 198.72: get you their own time \\n 202.80: [Applause] \\n 227.64: hello \\n 246.15: [Music] \\n 258.19: [Music] \\n 271.08: thank you \\n 287.40: tell me what you're rolling you would \\n 289.50: take it right now well then they'll pay \\n 292.14: me back \\n 293.24: this is the most expensive interview \\n 296.52: I've ever done yeah because I've we've \\n 299.16: kicked everybody out of this little \\n 300.84: trailer here and I've had a i bribed \\n 303.18: everybody with two drinks the whole lot \\n 305.46: of them that was a lot of them just so \\n 307.86: that I could spend a few minutes with \\n 309.84: Rachel \\n 313.44: you feel like you know somebody through \\n 315.72: their music because it touches you and \\n 318.06: you know I'm 49 I was actually conceived \\n 320.70: in the Summer of Love that's quite cool \\n 322.56: I saw you in 91 and it it touched me and \\n 326.34: it bloomed my mind and \\n 328.98: um it took me to another place whenever \\n 330.78: I see you it takes me to another place \\n 332.46: it's positive healing Vibes \\n 335.36: we do shows I I'm a real people Watcher \\n 339.72: anyway \\n 340.58: let's look at the audience \\n 343.26: and uh I see a lot of mainly I'd say a \\n 348.00: lot of Joy on people's faces yeah \\n 349.80: happiness and that's part of what makes \\n 352.32: it worthwhile doing it because it's just \\n 355.38: like sometimes you just see yeah pure \\n 357.42: joy is the only way to describe it \\n 358.98: sometimes of course there are people \\n 360.60: literally in tears in front of me but \\n 363.90: their tears of joy usually right usually \\n 366.18: it's not a painful it's not a painful \\n 369.00: but it's bringing back up bad memories \\n 371.46: we need more joy I mean it's like \\n 374.64: therapy in a way that we need it maybe \\n 378.54: more so than ever we need to spread the \\n 380.70: joy yes we do and I think with the \\n 384.72: internet and everything else you are \\n 386.72: bombarded 24 7. there is a lot of \\n 389.76: negativity in the world but I think \\n 391.86: there is also there's a lot of \\n 393.18: positivity as well there's a lot of \\n 394.86: people trying to find different ways of \\n 397.56: just finding the calm in in a really \\n 401.28: chaotic World there has been it seems \\n 403.20: like a psychedelic movement \\n 405.48: a Consciousness not just with music but \\n 407.46: yeah going on and people doing more yoga \\n 409.98: and meditation and looking inside trying \\n 412.92: to make sense and trying to make sense \\n 414.66: of it ourselves in the world \\n 416.88: I think for me when I see you play \\n 420.14: you make sense like the world makes \\n 423.00: sense when I'm watching you play and and \\n 426.30: that's a really nice feeling \\n 432.88: [Music] \\n 453.22:

[Music] \\n 1070.34: Cambridge \\n 1074.78: which is \\n 1076.18: opposite where I was born actually oh \\n 1078.56: you were born in Cambridge yeah and \\n 1080.06: Sid's drink was Guinness yes I'm around \\n 1082.70: yeah so it was just around the corner \\n 1084.32: from Mill Road so he'd go to the \\n 1085.76: locomotive every day and he'd drink two \\n 1087.44: parts of Guinness and then he'd go home \\n 1089.66: in pain to see him actually in the \\n 1091.58: Grafton Center in Cambridge and he got a \\n 1093.56: little bit annoyed about the the queen \\n 1096.20: well but does anybody in Britain really \\n 1098.36: like the queen \\n 1100.22: a mums do don't they \\n 1102.68: do it's good for tourism \\n 1105.92: yeah but but we we don't really do \\n 1108.62: anything I think the five of us are big \\n 1111.50: Queen fans \\n 1114.28: die I thought she was amazing you did \\n 1117.62: was that your most psychedelic \\n 1119.12: experience uh would you say that the \\n 1121.28: after effects were yeah the after \\n 1123.26: effects the after effects of watching \\n 1125.18: Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange on \\n 1127.16: LSD was very psychedelic yeah what were \\n 1130.40: they at you mean not while you were on \\n 1131.78: it but when you came off of it uh well I \\n 1133.94: was on it when I watched it but as the \\n 1136.58: film finished and I was still on \\n 1138.32: psychedelics that was that was very \\n 1140.78: psychedelic here I can imagine God that \\n 1143.36: movie is psychedelic on its own \\n 1144.80: absolutely yeah so do you think there is \\n 1147.44: like a new psychedelic scene happening \\n 1150.50: and maybe it's happening for a reason or \\n 1152.72: is it just maybe always been one but now \\n 1154.82: we just need it more I think the \\n 1157.10: Psychedelic scene is now coming out via \\n 1159.80: technology yes and as technology is \\n 1162.44: expanding and people can actually like \\n 1164.60: dip into things like modular \\n 1165.92: synthesizers \\n 1168.02: a budget monks and blue class systems \\n 1171.80: and stuff that whole thing that the San \\n 1174.20: Francisco tapes enter and the East Coast \\n 1176.74: mogue had \\n 1179.48: you can now kind of for 450 nine pounds \\n 1183.32: have your have your psychedelic \\n 1186.32: experience at home so definitely that's \\n 1188.30: a beautiful thing yeah it does cost \\n 1190.22: money then to have a psychic I mean \\n 1191.66: that's interesting it's Commerce isn't \\n 1193.22: it you know it doesn't psychedelics \\n 1195.44: don't come free not very easy I just had \\n 1199.04: a sound healing experience in London a \\n 1201.50: friend of mine did a sound healing with \\n 1203.54: lots of just instruments from all over \\n 1205.40: the world and it was it was pretty \\n 1207.74: psychedelic have you ever guys done a \\n 1209.90: sound healing in the in the Californian \\n 1212.72: desert just near me so we were bowling \\n 1215.48: it was made from Colts had a different \\n 1217.94: pitch and various pitches would connect \\n 1221.30: with various parts of your body so your \\n 1223.40: digestive system lungs you know your \\n 1227.24: heart obviously yeah and um I found it \\n 1230.42: amazing \\n 1231.68: we weren't supposed to record it you're \\n 1233.54: supposed to lie down and close your eyes \\n 1234.98: close your eyes I did record it so you \\n 1236.96: bootlegged it yeah but I wanted to \\n 1239.96: relive it and come back to England after \\n 1242.18: being in the Californian desert and \\n 1243.98: actually experience it alone myself back \\n 1247.16: in rainy Cambridge I think any kind of \\n 1250.16: nature areas where you you can kind of \\n 1255.28: feel like you're a minuscule part of \\n 1258.68: something bigger than yourself such as a \\n 1261.08: nature reserve like the Joshua Tree \\n 1263.66: nature reserve and yeah Yosemite Park oh \\n 1268.04: Yosemite California is just filled with \\n 1270.56: amazing nature isn't it Big Sur it is \\n 1273.02: it's a very spiritual place I can see \\n 1274.46: why so much musical inspiration is from \\n 1276.68: there yeah and I kind of want to just go \\n 1278.72: and live there but well it's really cool \\n 1280.22: to talk to you guys and \\n 1282.62: um I mean I I think you guys are \\n 1286.40: psychedelic in the sense that your music \\n 1288.80: touches me and it makes me feel good \\n 1291.62: it's like a natural high well thank you \\n 1293.66: thanks guys really enjoyed it so much \\n 1296.12: fun see you guys soon \\n
