third thing I didn't\\n 23.79: emphasize this enough last time if\\n 25.38: there's any problems with the course any\\n 27.33: sort of error typos and the homework\\n 29.43: sets typos in the book anything I say if\\n 31.80: it seems wrong in lecture please come to\\n 33.57: me immediately and I can issue\\n 35.25: corrections and therefore not get\\n 36.96: everyone is you know it confused as much\\n 38.58: as we can so just you know either post a\\n 40.68: message on the message boards and the\\n 42.06: email catch me after lecture or you know\\n 44.52: I know it's crazy but you can call me\\n 45.93: maybe yeah anyway so last time we we\\n 53.55: left off we were talking about heat\\n 54.75: capacity of solids and we started with\\n 63.48: the Boltzmann picture of a solid and\\n 65.84: Boltzmann's picture both months picture\\n 70.11: was that an atom in a solid should be\\n 72.00: thought of as sitting in the bottom of a\\n 73.65: harmonic oscillator oscillating back and\\n 75.15: forth and from that picture he was able\\n 77.73: to derive the law of do long petit heat\\n 80.73: capacity per atom is three KB it's\\n 83.58: pretty good result except it didn't\\n 85.53: agree at low temperature where the heat\\n 86.88: capacity of solids drops Einstein\\n 89.40: figured out what was going on he added\\n 92.49: quantum mechanics and due to quantum\\n 95.22: mechanics the energy levels of the\\n 97.53: harmonic oscillator to get quantized and\\n 99.27: when the temperature drops below the\\n 101.46: quantization energy the oscillator gets\\n 103.80: frozen his ground state and the heat\\n 105.36: capacity drops sea drops at low\\n 108.27: temperature drops at low T and his\\n 113.10: prediction was it should drop\\n 114.99: exponentially exponentially his theory\\n 121.41: of heat capacity fit the data pretty\\n 123.27: well and indeed it predicted this drop\\n 125.73: of heat capacity at low temperature but\\n 127.80: unfortunately experiment said experiment\\n 132.14: said that at low temperature the heat\\n 134.31: capacities are proportional to T cubed\\n 136.29: not dropping exponentially so that\\n 140.01: brings us to the subject of today which\\n 142.38: is the Debye theory if I was 1912 and\\n 146.40: the devised intuition was that you\\n 149.25: cannot think of a solid as a bunch of\\n 151.59: atoms in the bottom of our heart\\n 153.12: harmonic well because when one atom\\n 155.22: moves it does get pushed back to its\\n 157.11: original position by its neighbor but in\\n 158.94: the process it pushes its neighbor and\\n 160.38: then his neighbors pushes its neighbor\\n 161.49: and so forth and so on so in fact what\\n 164.37: we should be thinking about is the\\n 166.02: vibration in a solid is actually a wave\\n 171.56: and in particular vibrational waves are\\n 175.14: sound now something was already known\\n 179.91: about how waves behave under the\\n 182.70: influence of quantum mechanics all the\\n 184.47: way back in 1899 Max Planck had done\\n 187.08: this black body radiation calculation\\n 188.94: and when when Max Planck did this\\n 190.32: calculation he actually had no idea what\\n 192.00: he was doing he didn't even like what he\\n 193.53: was doing he said it was a act of\\n 195.15: complete despair never really liked the\\n 197.16: calculation very much but thirteen years\\n 199.20: later people started to understand\\n 200.88: little bits and pieces about quantum\\n 202.20: mechanics and plunks original\\n 204.21: calculations seem to make a lot more\\n 206.34: sense\\n 206.97: so Debye thought that what we should do\\n 208.74: is we should quantize the sound waves\\n 210.75: just like light like light the general\\n 218.91: idea is you know this is in modern\\n 221.82: language you know plunk didn't\\n 223.14: understand this but but we understand\\n 224.70: this now is from Einsteins work we know\\n 227.19: that the energy of a given oscillator\\n 229.53: would be H bar Omega times the bose\\n 233.76: factor beta H bar Omega plus the zero\\n 237.03: point energy plus one half and so if we\\n 240.69: have the the picture that the you know\\n 243.36: of we interpret Planck as now and with\\n 245.43: Debye understood is that each wave mode\\n 248.85: in a box in a Menelik you put your\\n 251.16: material in a box\\n 251.94: each wave mode in that box should be\\n 253.59: treated as an oscillator so the total\\n 256.53: energy e total inside your box is the\\n 260.40: sum over all wave modes\\n 262.65: of h-bar Omega for that mode times Lois\\n 267.84: factor beta H bar Omega for the mode\\n 271.16: mode plus one half and all you have to\\n 274.80: do is sum over all the modes in the box\\n 276.99: now the reason this is going to give you\\n 278.70: something different from what Einstein\\n 279.96: had was because whenever you have a\\n 282.72: bunch of modes in the box some of those\\n 284.16: modes are going to be low temperature\\n 286.53: low energy modes or low frequency modes\\n 288.39: so in Einstein's calculation when the\\n 291.57: temperature dropped below the frequency\\n 293.70: of the oscillator then the heat capacity\\n 296.28: dropped but the idea here is we have a\\n 298.08: whole distribution of frequencies in the\\n 299.91: modes in our box and so as we lower the\\n 301.86: temperature there will always be some\\n 304.83: modes of low enough frequency that will\\n 306.57: still have some heat capacity left so\\n 308.91: the heat capacity won't drop\\n 310.11: exponentially as we go to low\\n 312.66: temperature so that's the intuition now\\n 315.27: there's going to be some differences\\n 316.71: between what clock did and what Debye\\n 320.10: did because light is obviously different\\n 322.83: from sound in many ways one way is that\\n 324.84: light is of course a lot faster than\\n 326.46: sound\\n 326.91: but that's only sort of a quantitative\\n 329.73: difference there's some more qualitative\\n 331.89: differences that we're going to have to\\n 333.06: deal with and one in particular\\n 335.04: light versus sound is that light has two\\n 341.43: polarizations of polarizations and sound\\n 346.71: has three polarizations now you'll\\n 352.11: remember from your enm that if a light\\n 354.90: wave is or an electromagnetic wave of\\n 356.67: any sort is going in the x direction the\\n 358.89: electric field has to be in the Y\\n 361.11: direction or the Z direction it can't be\\n 363.18: in the X direction sound is not like\\n 365.64: that if a sound wave is going in the X\\n 367.47: direction the polarization of the sound\\n 369.78: wave can be in any direction let me show\\n 371.43: you it's probably easiest to explain\\n 372.60: this with a movie so let me show you the\\n 375.54: movie of what I mean by this this is\\n 377.94: what's known as a longitudinal wave\\n 380.12: which means that the atoms are moving\\n 382.92: back and forth in the same direction\\n 384.90: that the wave is actually going so the\\n 387.57: wave is going the X direction and the\\n 389.49: atoms are moving back and forth in the X\\n 391.68: direction so this doesn't occur for\\n 394.71: light for light\\n 396.51: the wave is going the x-direction the\\n 398.07: electromagnetic field is always pointing\\n 400.02: in the y direction of the z direction\\n 400.94: more similar to light is what's known as\\n 403.35: a transverse wave where the light is\\n 406.29: good where the wave is going in the X\\n 408.30: direction but the atoms are actually\\n 410.16: moving back and forth in the Y direction\\n 412.77: or the Z direction okay so with sound\\n 415.68: you can actually have three\\n 416.76: polarizations the atoms can be moving in\\n 418.44: any direction whereas in light the\\n 420.84: electric field has to point in only two\\n 422.49: possible directions is that clear yeah\\n 425.19: okay good so we're gonna have to keep\\n 428.67: track of the fact that we have three\\n 430.89: polarizations for light and only two for\\n 434.37: sap the other way around\\n 435.51: three polarization for sound and only\\n 437.34: two for light there's a couple of things\\n 439.41: we're going to also do which are going\\n 441.36: to be approximations which are going to\\n 443.70: make our life simpler one is that we're\\n 445.95: going to assume the velocity of sound V\\n 450.81: sound is independent of polarization in\\n 453.90: depth of pull this is not actually true\\n 459.81: in reality almost always the transverse\\n 462.57: mode is slower it has a lower velocity\\n 465.21: than the longitudinal mode but it's\\n 468.84: actually not so much more complicated to\\n 470.85: treat this properly but you don't learn\\n 472.71: a whole lot more from doing it more\\n 474.48: properly I think there's an exercise in\\n 476.07: the book that asks you to do it more\\n 477.27: properly but we're just going to assume\\n 478.77: all sound waves have the same same\\n 480.84: velocity independent of whether they're\\n 482.54: longitudinal or transverse as long as\\n 486.39: we're assuming things which are not\\n 488.13: really correct we might as well assume V\\n 490.98: sound is independent of direction of\\n 494.45: direction which is often not true also\\n 498.14: frequently when you have a real solid\\n 500.16: the speed of sound depends on which\\n 502.23: direction the solid you're going we'll\\n 504.21: discuss that a little bit more later on\\n 505.83: in the term but again it's something\\n 508.92: that if you treat it more properly it's\\n 510.21: not that much harder and you don't learn\\n 511.92: so much more from doing it so we're not\\n 513.60: going to to do it more properly but just\\n 516.81: keep in mind that we are making these\\n 518.37: approximations now if you remember back\\n 520.47: to plunks calculation which you did last\\n 524.10: year the first thing you had to worry\\n 526.17: about was counting all of the modes in a\\n 528.66: box does that sound familiar\\n 530.37: a little bit familiar we're gonna go\\n 532.02: through that again because it's\\n 533.19: important and we're gonna use a lot of\\n 534.75: the a lot of the mechanism is to do many\\n 537.93: other things this year so it's worth\\n 539.19: going through so this is a little aside\\n 542.46: on counting waves in a box counting\\n 544.89: waves modes I guess modes in box so it\\n 553.17: starts start with a one dimensional box\\n 554.85: 1d box so let's draw the one dimensional\\n 558.09: box here it is it has some length L we\\n 562.80: can write down a wave in that box with\\n 566.28: hard wall boundary conditions and PI x\\n 569.01: over L as you know comes to zero at both\\n 572.46: ends because of the hard wall boundary\\n 573.87: conditions and this is a perfectly good\\n 575.64: way to write down the waves in the box\\n 577.50: for every different positive integer n\\n 579.15: you have a different wave mode that's\\n 581.52: okay but it's not not what we're gonna\\n 582.84: do what we're gonna do is instead we're\\n 587.19: going to use what's known as periodic\\n 589.65: boundary conditions you may have\\n 590.97: discussed this last year periodic\\n 593.43: boundary conditions boundaries also\\n 597.57: known as born von-karman boundary\\n 599.64: conditions born von Karman Carmen Carmen\\n 605.42: born was one of the Max born was one of\\n 608.58: the creators of quantum mechanics and\\n 611.19: Theodore von Karman was a very important\\n 613.95: mathematician Max Born is also very\\n 615.66: significant because he was Olivia\\n 617.07: newton-john's grandfather she's an\\n 618.60: important pop star if you don't know her\\n 620.13: she was important for my generation at\\n 621.99: any rate so anyway people don't see me\\n 625.80: sufficiently impressed by that statement\\n 627.75: it's it's actually it's it's anyway okay\\n 630.03: so the idea of a periodic boundary\\n 631.53: condition is we're going to take our box\\n 632.76: of length L and we're going to wrap it\\n 634.62: up into a circle of circumference L then\\n 639.87: we're gonna measure X going around the\\n 641.52: box in this way like that and the reason\\n 644.61: we're doing this is because once we do\\n 646.92: this the waves can take the form e to\\n 649.56: the ikx we don't have to work with sines\\n 652.23: and cosines if we have a periodic box in\\n 655.23: a circle we can use Exponential's and if\\n 657.72: you haven't learned already by this time\\n 659.64: in your career Exponential's are just a\\n 661.44: lot easier to work with the\\n 663.24: signs and co-signs now when we write a\\n 665.82: wave e to the ikx we have to be a little\\n 669.09: bit careful because the coordinate X and\\n 672.51: the coordinate X plus L are actually the\\n 675.99: same coordinate if you go a distance L\\n 678.18: around the the box and get back to\\n 680.61: exactly the same point so this wave form\\n 683.43: must be exactly the same whether we plug\\n 685.89: in X or X plus L so we better have you\\n 690.57: know if this is going to make sense we\\n 691.71: better have e to the ikx equal to e to\\n 694.56: the I K X plus L okay or otherwise into\\n 700.35: the I KL has to equal 1 or K has to be 2\\n 705.57: PI over L times an integer N and that\\n 709.32: integer can be positive or negative or\\n 711.09: is whatever we like ok everyone happy\\n 715.08: with that so far so good\\n 717.21: ok so this means that the spacing\\n 719.46: between allowed between between allowed\\n 725.43: allowed Ches Ches is 2 PI over L ll\\n 732.75: being the circumference of our loop and\\n 735.36: in particular if we ever have to sum\\n 737.88: over all the k's we can replace that sum\\n 740.88: by an integral decay times a factor of L\\n 744.54: over 2 pi did you go through this\\n 747.36: argument last year\\n 748.32: a little bit yes well ok we're going to\\n 751.29: use it an awful lot this year so that's\\n 753.33: why I'm going through it again because\\n 754.65: it's important now we of course don't\\n 759.18: live in one dimension so we have to\\n 761.70: think as multi-dimensional people we\\n 763.74: have to think in multiple dimensions so\\n 766.11: in 3d we're going to take an L by L by L\\n 770.19: periodic box periodic box and at this\\n 776.13: point you might start to be a little bit\\n 778.14: upset because there's no such thing as\\n 780.51: an L by L by L periodic box in the real\\n 783.39: world you would have to have a box for\\n 785.82: which if you went a distance L in any\\n 787.98: direction you came back to exactly where\\n 789.66: you started in three dimensions you\\n 791.28: can't build such a thing they just don't\\n 792.87: exist so why is it we're going to do\\n 794.94: this though the point is you\\n 796.87: doesn't actually matter what you do with\\n 798.58: the boundaries of your system for almost\\n 800.83: any quantity you're actually interested\\n 802.72: in calculating such as the heat capacity\\n 804.82: it's something that you could measure\\n 806.11: locally just in a small region of the\\n 808.75: actual physical system so it doesn't\\n 810.79: matter what you would do with the\\n 811.69: boundaries which could be very very far\\n 813.31: away so you can use hard wall boundary\\n 815.83: conditions you can use periodic boundary\\n 817.21: conditions you can use any other type of\\n 818.77: boundary condition which is convenient\\n 820.54: and for us it's convenient to use these\\n 822.46: periodic boundary conditions and we're\\n 824.20: going to get away with it the reason we\\n 826.18: want to use these periodic boundary\\n 827.35: conditions is because then the waves\\n 828.73: will look like a TVI cave vector dot X\\n 831.67: vector it's an exponential Exponential's\\n 834.49: are easy to work with and that's why\\n 836.23: we're doing it everyone that's still\\n 838.00: happy with that okay good so in three\\n 840.91: dimensions K has to be two PI over L\\n 844.66: times integers and x and y and and Z and\\n 848.58: so if we ever have a sum over K vectors\\n 852.97: we can replace that sum with L over 2 PI\\n 856.95: cubed times the integral DK X integral\\n 861.22: DK y integral DK Z or another way that\\n 865.93: we will most usually write this will\\n 867.67: write this as the volume of the system\\n 870.48: times the integral d 3k over 2 PI cubed\\n 876.33: and we'll see this factored volume\\n 879.45: integral D 3k over 2 PI cubed probably\\n 882.91: see it a hundred times this year before\\n 884.53: we're done ok so what we're going to do\\n 887.05: is we're going to use what we just\\n 889.24: learned about counting waves in a box to\\n 891.70: apply to this equation here so there's\\n 893.86: some over modes here I can write sum\\n 896.20: over modes is going to become the sum\\n 899.98: over all possible K vectors for our\\n 902.92: modes but then times a factor of three\\n 905.20: and the factor of three is from the\\n 907.36: three polarizations we can have one\\n 909.01: longitudinal or two transverse\\n 910.51: polarizations and then this sum we're\\n 913.87: going to use this law here to convert it\\n 916.24: into an integral so now we have three\\n 918.82: factor of the volume integral d 3k over\\n 923.35: 2 PI cubed now since we've assumed over\\n 929.83: here\\n 930.82: everything is isotropic you know the way\\n 933.16: it's philosophies are independent of\\n 934.75: direction we can then take this three\\n 937.42: dimensional Cartesian integral and turn\\n 939.73: it into a spherical polar integral so\\n 942.55: that we have three times the volume\\n 944.74: let's pull out the 2 PI cubed here and\\n 948.07: then we have integral 4 PI K squared\\n 953.29: DK from 0 to infinity as this familiar\\n 957.64: the 4 pi is the integral over the\\n 959.05: spherical directions yes 3 aqua polar\\n 962.29: coordinates everyone's happy with that\\n 963.66: finally since we're thinking about sound\\n 966.88: for sound you've probably learned in\\n 968.65: your fluids course last year or last\\n 970.63: less term frequency is proportional to\\n 974.50: the wave vector and the proportionality\\n 976.42: constant is the velocity velocity of the\\n 981.67: sound so let's just change that integral\\n 984.55: into an integral over frequency instead\\n 987.25: of an integral over wave vector so that\\n 989.20: becomes a plus some factors here as pull\\n 991.42: out a 4 pi upstairs we have a 2 pi cube\\n 995.70: downstairs I guess we have velocity cube\\n 999.13: downstairs and then we have an integral\\n 1000.72: 0 to infinity of Omega squared D Omega\\n 1004.44: and I'm going to write that as just\\n 1009.62: defining a quantity G of Omega D Omega 0\\n 1014.31: to infinity and this G of Omega is just\\n 1019.23: a bunch of those constants I'm going to\\n 1020.55: stick together so I guess I have 12 12\\n 1023.85: pi upstairs and I have 2 PI cubed\\n 1027.00: downstairs I guess I have a velocity\\n 1029.55: cube downstairs and then I have a volume\\n 1032.79: upstairs and I'm gonna write the volume\\n 1034.59: upstairs in sort of a tricky way I'm\\n 1036.81: gonna write it as the number of atoms\\n 1038.61: divided by the volume downstairs that's\\n 1041.49: the density and then the number of atoms\\n 1043.62: upstairs that's gonna be convenient and\\n 1046.11: then I need also that Omega squared\\n 1049.82: Omega squared so this quantity here is\\n 1053.85: known as which I put it over here G of\\n 1057.99: Omega is known as G of Omega is known as\\n 1061.56: the density of states and\\n 1063.20: think you ran into this last year when\\n 1065.27: you do blackbody radiation the idea of a\\n 1068.90: density of states is that it is\\n 1072.31: basically how many of these modes you\\n 1075.17: have at a given frequency in particular\\n 1077.87: G Omega D Omega equals number of modes\\n 1084.22: with frequency frequency between between\\n 1092.74: Omega and Omega Plus D Omega so if you\\n 1099.23: want to sum over all the modes in the\\n 1101.30: system instead of just summing all the\\n 1103.46: modes what you do is you integrate over\\n 1105.05: all frequencies times the number of\\n 1107.09: modes at each frequency okay sort of a\\n 1109.81: convenient way to do things\\n 1111.89: I'm actually also going to simplify this\\n 1114.89: a little bit further by defining another\\n 1116.98: convenient quantity I'm gonna rewrite\\n 1119.60: this G of Omega G of Omega as I'm gonna\\n 1124.04: write it as pull out the N number of\\n 1126.71: atoms then nine Omega squared over Omega\\n 1131.03: D cubed so I'm defining Omega D cubed\\n 1133.85: here to be a bunch of those constants\\n 1135.86: stuck together Omega D cubed is 6 pi\\n 1139.46: squared times the density number over\\n 1142.70: volume times velocity of sound cubed\\n 1146.92: this is known as the Debye frequency\\n 1149.65: after mr. Debye frequency and at least\\n 1155.51: for now\\n 1156.23: we're just going to think of it as this\\n 1157.70: bunch of constants that we've\\n 1159.23: conveniently defined so it's easier to\\n 1160.82: write G and in a moment we'll give it a\\n 1163.01: more important meaning but for now it's\\n 1164.69: just those bunch of constants okay so\\n 1169.12: having done all of that we can then way\\n 1172.13: up there at the very top of the board we\\n 1173.81: have the expression for the energy as a\\n 1176.36: sum over all of the modes so I'm\\n 1179.54: actually maybe I'll put it over here so\\n 1182.78: I don't have to scroll that off the top\\n 1184.07: of the board\\n 1184.70: so we'll now write the energy the total\\n 1188.51: energy at a given temperature instead of\\n 1191.21: writing it as a sum over all the modes\\n 1193.10: I'm going to write it as an integral\\n 1195.11: over frequencies\\n 1196.67: equals integral D Omega from 0 to\\n 1199.79: infinity G of Omega that's the sum over\\n 1202.10: all modes by integrating over frequency\\n 1204.77: and the thing that we want to integrate\\n 1205.91: is H bar Omega bows factor beta H bar\\n 1209.99: Omega plus 1/2 ok people happy with that\\n 1215.72: what we're doing yes yes maybe yeah ok\\n 1219.65: good\\n 1220.18: all right so this is the expression that\\n 1223.22: we're going to try to evaluate and if\\n 1225.56: you're paying really close attention\\n 1226.51: you'll be upset with me already because\\n 1229.85: it's actually infinite this total energy\\n 1233.36: in the box is infinite and the reason\\n 1235.88: it's infinite is because of this plus\\n 1237.92: 1/2 look at what the plus 1/2 multiplies\\n 1241.52: it multiplies a factor of Omega G of\\n 1243.65: Omega is proportional to Omega squared\\n 1245.51: so it's the integral of Omega cubed from\\n 1247.73: 0 to infinity\\n 1248.78: that's infinite so that's kind of it you\\n 1251.30: might think that's kind of a problem\\n 1252.88: actually it didn't bother to buy or\\n 1254.90: plunk because they didn't know about\\n 1256.10: zero-point energy so they never wrote\\n 1257.57: down this plus 1/2 but it's not gonna\\n 1259.43: bother us either for a number of reasons\\n 1261.14: the main reason it's not going to bother\\n 1262.67: us is because it gives us an infinite\\n 1264.83: quantity but it's an infinite quantity\\n 1267.35: that's independent of temperature the\\n 1269.39: only place in this expression where\\n 1270.95: temperature occurs is right here at the\\n 1273.08: end of the day we want heat capacity\\n 1275.09: which is the derivative of the energy\\n 1276.32: with respect to temperature so we're\\n 1278.09: gonna have to differentiate this thing\\n 1279.26: with respect to temperature and the 1/2\\n 1281.75: is going to go away because it's\\n 1282.95: temperature independent so it's giving\\n 1284.30: us an infinite but temperature\\n 1286.10: independent contribution so we don't\\n 1287.72: care about it actually in a few moments\\n 1289.76: we're gonna see another reason why we're\\n 1291.29: not gonna care about that 1/2 but for\\n 1293.51: now we'll just realize it's not going to\\n 1295.70: change our expression for the heat\\n 1297.50: capacity all right so now we can plug in\\n 1301.25: the density of states into this equation\\n 1303.83: here so let's do that so we get 9 and\\n 1306.98: I'll pull out the H bar from over there\\n 1309.17: there's Omega 2 by cubed here cubed\\n 1312.47: downstairs and then the thing we have\\n 1315.05: left to integrate integral D Omega from\\n 1317.75: 0 to infinity\\n 1318.77: there's Omega cubed upstairs and then\\n 1321.35: the bose factor e to the beta H bar\\n 1323.12: Omega minus 1 is left that looks a\\n 1327.02: little bit ugly but we can take this\\n 1329.78: integral\\n 1330.56: we can simplify it a little bit by\\n 1332.12: writing x equals beta H bar Omega and\\n 1335.66: then the integral turns into 1 over beta\\n 1339.05: H bar to the fourth times this integral\\n 1342.95: integral DX from 0 to infinity of X\\n 1346.25: cubed e to the X minus 1 and I promise\\n 1351.14: you no one is ever going to ask you to\\n 1352.76: evaluate this integral it's just some\\n 1354.83: number the number happens to be PI to\\n 1356.81: the fourth over 15 and if you really\\n 1360.17: want to know where that number comes\\n 1361.58: from you it's in the you know appendix\\n 1364.37: of one of the chapters of the book don't\\n 1366.71: you hate it when someone says you can go\\n 1367.91: read the book but in fact it's not so\\n 1369.59: important it just gives us a number the\\n 1370.85: important thing is it gives us some\\n 1372.17: known number so we can put that number\\n 1374.27: in and get the end result that the\\n 1378.17: energy the total energy in the box is 9\\n 1381.86: and KBT to the fourth I'm here divided\\n 1387.47: by H bar Omega Debye cubed times this\\n 1391.34: factor part of the fourth over 15 ok\\n 1397.01: good and then of course we can\\n 1399.71: differentiate this to get the heat\\n 1401.42: capacity heat capacity is de DT and okay\\n 1407.45: so it's n KB KB T over H bar I'll make\\n 1413.63: it 2 by cubed and then I guess 12 PI to\\n 1418.16: the fourth over 5 what's so that's the\\n 1421.58: heat capacity and so a couple of things\\n 1423.80: to comment about this it makes this\\n 1425.42: exciting first of all it's proportional\\n 1427.55: to T cubed\\n 1428.36: just like the by wanted you get the T\\n 1430.88: cubed dependence of the heat capacity as\\n 1433.43: expected it shouldn't be surprising that\\n 1435.77: you get this T cubed heat capacity\\n 1437.51: because you remember from the blackbody\\n 1439.40: radiation calculation you did last year\\n 1441.89: that the energy of radiation the energy\\n 1444.14: of waves in a box that you calculated is\\n 1446.38: proportional to T to the fourth you\\n 1448.61: should have expected the energy to be T\\n 1450.14: to the fourth and then you differentiate\\n 1451.61: it once and you get T cubed so this is\\n 1453.86: why Debye expected that by treating the\\n 1455.66: waves the same way we treated radiation\\n 1458.05: we would get the T cubed law furthermore\\n 1462.74: there's something really\\n 1464.21: fighting about this formula here and\\n 1465.59: that is that there's no free parameters\\n 1468.47: remember when Einstein did his\\n 1469.79: calculation he had this frequency this\\n 1471.53: Einstein frequency the oscillator\\n 1473.18: frequency which he didn't know how to\\n 1475.70: come up with this frequency he just fit\\n 1477.44: it to the experiment to try to make it\\n 1478.85: all look nice here there's no free\\n 1480.80: parameter Omega Debye here is fixed by\\n 1484.52: the density and the sound velocity so\\n 1487.22: everything is fixed here and if and if\\n 1488.72: you calculate this quantity and you\\n 1490.88: compare it to low temperature heat\\n 1492.17: capacity of most materials it actually\\n 1494.75: actually agrees extremely well but\\n 1498.05: unfortunately like you know you never\\n 1500.48: get anything for free so we still have a\\n 1503.45: problem problem at high T we want the\\n 1512.30: law of do long petite C over N is 3 KB\\n 1515.57: and we didn't get that we got T cubed at\\n 1518.42: all temperatures here and this is where\\n 1520.49: the BI had to actually scratch his head\\n 1522.50: a little bit and think ok what did I do\\n 1524.39: wrong\\n 1525.40: incidentally if you do this calculation\\n 1527.18: for electromagnetic radiation it really\\n 1530.30: is T to the fourth energy all the way up\\n 1532.88: to arbitrarily high temperature where as\\n 1535.34: you know in a solid we know that the\\n 1537.38: heat capacity the solid at some high\\n 1539.27: temperature is going to give us just\\n 1540.50: three KB it's not going to be T cubed so\\n 1544.60: here we have to deviate from plunks\\n 1547.22: calculation we have to do something\\n 1548.39: different from what it was that plunk\\n 1551.03: did and plunk and Debye understood that\\n 1555.11: where he was going wrong where he was\\n 1557.57: going wrong you know he has to think\\n 1559.31: about where this three comes from where\\n 1560.87: is this three from the three comes from\\n 1562.82: the fact that the atom can move in three\\n 1565.34: directions each atom moves in three\\n 1567.68: possible directions you can figure this\\n 1568.94: three degrees of freedom that the atom\\n 1571.64: has and how many degrees of freedom did\\n 1574.55: he count in his box well the total\\n 1577.76: number of modes number of modes that he\\n 1579.86: counted his integral from 0 to infinity\\n 1583.01: G Omega D Omega and G of Omega goes as\\n 1586.88: Omega squared you integrate that into\\n 1588.38: infinity and that gives you infinity so\\n 1591.29: he counted an infinite number of degrees\\n 1593.00: of freedom and he said well wait I'm I\\n 1595.34: counted an infinite number of modes in\\n 1597.05: the box but there's a fine\\n 1598.10: of degrees of freedom each atom can move\\n 1600.26: in three directions and there shouldn't\\n 1601.91: be more than that many degrees of\\n 1603.32: freedom in my box so somehow I have to\\n 1605.69: fix that problem and make the Box have\\n 1608.18: only a fixed number of degrees of\\n 1609.98: freedom not an infinite number of\\n 1611.33: degrees of freedom so how did he do that\\n 1613.51: impose a cutoff so what he's going to do\\n 1619.43: is he's going to declare some frequency\\n 1622.37: cutoff Omega cutoff G Omega D Omega such\\n 1629.78: that there are exactly three n modes in\\n 1632.54: the box now this is an ad-hoc solution\\n 1636.17: and it's kind of a little weird so what\\n 1639.23: he's doing is he's saying we have all\\n 1641.00: these wave modes in a box and when you\\n 1642.71: get to Psalm a frequency known as the\\n 1644.99: cutoff frequency above that there are no\\n 1647.39: more wave modes left you have no sound\\n 1649.22: moves above this above this frequency\\n 1650.96: anymore seems a little strange later in\\n 1653.15: the term we're going to see it's maybe\\n 1654.14: not as strange as we thought but at then\\n 1656.48: at that time maybe it seemed a little\\n 1658.10: odd but he's gonna do it anyway so we're\\n 1659.87: gonna do this anyway we're gonna follow\\n 1660.95: him and see what happens first thing we\\n 1663.89: need to do is we have to figure out what\\n 1664.94: this cutoff frequency is going to be\\n 1666.86: such it's going to give us exactly three\\n 1669.68: n modes so let's calculate this thing\\n 1671.86: well plug in G Omega so plug in G of\\n 1675.92: Omega here so there's a nine and there's\\n 1678.47: Omega two by cubed integral 0 to Omega\\n 1681.62: cutoff Omega squared D Omega so I just\\n 1686.54: plugged in G of Omega there and then\\n 1688.61: let's do that integral and we get three\\n 1691.40: n Omega cutoff cubed over Omega D I\\n 1696.59: cubed by cubed and we want this to equal\\n 1701.06: three N and in order for that to be true\\n 1703.91: we better choose Omega cutoff equal to\\n 1708.86: Omega 2 bi okay that's why I happen to\\n 1713.30: choose those particular constants as\\n 1715.94: being Omega 2 by Omega 2 by is the\\n 1718.64: cutoff frequency if you cut off your\\n 1720.53: Moser at the Debye frequency you only\\n 1722.72: count modes at lower frequencies in the\\n 1724.85: Debye frequency you have exactly 3n\\n 1726.83: modes okay all right so now we're going\\n 1731.33: to go back to the\\n 1732.02: equation over here and we're going to\\n 1734.45: rewrite the total energy in the box now\\n 1736.82: as the integral counting up modes not to\\n 1741.65: infinity now I'm only up to Omega 2 by G\\n 1745.01: Omega and then the bose factor beta H\\n 1748.67: bar Omega and then plus 1/2 zero-point\\n 1752.12: energy and you'll notice now because\\n 1754.49: we've cut off our number of modes this\\n 1757.13: term no longer diverges it's a finite\\n 1759.34: zero-point energy term and that makes us\\n 1761.69: a little bit happier but again we can\\n 1764.33: actually ignore it\\n 1765.77: drop this because it's temperature\\n 1769.34: independent it's a temperature\\n 1770.63: independent zero-point energy we're\\n 1772.55: going to differentiate the thing anyway\\n 1773.93: so we don't really care about it it's\\n 1775.70: just going to give us some overall\\n 1776.66: constant shift in the energy which isn't\\n 1779.27: very interesting so we're going to drop\\n 1780.71: that anyway ok and then this expression\\n 1783.98: should give us the energy in the box or\\n 1785.63: the heat capacity in the box once we\\n 1786.86: differentiate it at any temperature we\\n 1788.63: choose just by plugging the temperature\\n 1790.52: in here but it's useful to look at\\n 1793.34: various limits so the first limit is low\\n 1795.98: temperature limit and by that I mean KBT\\n 1799.69: much less than h-bar omega Debye and in\\n 1803.72: this limit we get the same result same\\n 1806.39: result as we had before this result here\\n 1810.44: exactly this nothing changes why is that\\n 1813.62: well the reason nothing changes is\\n 1816.17: because at low temperature this bose\\n 1818.60: factor vanishes very quickly with\\n 1821.15: frequency by the time you're up near the\\n 1823.55: Debye frequency the bose factor is\\n 1825.59: essentially zero anyway so it doesn't\\n 1827.33: matter if you cut it off at the Debye\\n 1828.65: frequency or twice the Debye frequency\\n 1829.97: or half the divide frequency the\\n 1831.95: integrand is zero anyway by that time so\\n 1834.62: you just you don't have to worry about\\n 1835.91: the cutoff at all at low temperature the\\n 1837.98: cutoff isn't doing anything so you still\\n 1839.63: get the T cubed heat capacity which is\\n 1841.82: what we want but at high temperature at\\n 1845.33: high temperature we have something\\n 1847.16: different well ok so let's look at the\\n 1849.80: Bose factor at high temperature at high\\n 1853.55: temperature beta H bar Omega is a small\\n 1855.71: number so we can expand the exponential\\n 1858.02: so we get 1 plus beta H bar Omega plus\\n 1861.23: cot minus 1 so the ones cancel we get 1\\n 1865.50: over beta H bar Omega or we get the bose\\n 1868.80: factor is replaced and bose becomes K BT\\n 1873.44: over H bar Omega so if we then take this\\n 1878.40: bose factor and plug it into that energy\\n 1880.53: expression again dropping the zero-point\\n 1883.53: energy the energy is now integral zero\\n 1886.50: to sorry to I'll make it to by up to the\\n 1889.11: cutoff D Omega G Omega then we have H\\n 1893.01: bar Omega and then we have the Bose\\n 1894.69: factor which is KB T over H bar Omega\\n 1897.41: the H bar Omega scan sille and we get\\n 1900.93: the energy being given by pull out the\\n 1903.06: KBT and integral 0 to Omega D by D Omega\\n 1908.66: G Omega and this integral here has been\\n 1912.63: designed to give us exactly 3 n so we\\n 1917.19: get the energy in the box is 3 and KBT\\n 1921.21: or the heat capacity is 3n KB the law of\\n 1928.29: do long petite so by implementing this\\n 1931.17: cutoff Debye managed to get the loads\\n 1934.26: temperatures heat capacity is T cubed\\n 1936.51: the high temperature heat capacity is\\n 1938.43: still the law of do long petite so\\n 1940.86: that's pretty good\\n 1942.33: let's look at some actual data so this\\n 1947.22: is the heat capacity of silver over a\\n 1949.80: broad range of temperature and up at\\n 1951.84: high temperature you see it's it's\\n 1953.55: converging to the law of do long petite\\n 1956.67: and at low temperature it's roughly T\\n 1959.82: cubed and the Debye Theory agrees with\\n 1962.52: the experiment extremely extremely well\\n 1964.80: you can see on the same on the same plot\\n 1967.05: there's the Einstein theory which fits\\n 1968.88: pretty good but not quite as well as to\\n 1971.07: by particularly at low temperature and\\n 1972.66: but on additional really important\\n 1975.45: improvement from Einstein to Dubai is\\n 1977.97: that Debye has no free parameters that\\n 1980.58: everything is fixed in the Debye theory\\n 1982.56: by just the velocity of sound of the\\n 1984.51: density so there's no no you can't muck\\n 1986.73: around you can't adjust things it just\\n 1988.38: fits by itself so it's a really good\\n 1990.21: result and it seems to agree extremely\\n 1992.52: well with the experiment but we still\\n 1995.34: have problem it's still wrong or still\\n 1998.10: Wow\\n 1998.90: things that are still wrong one is the\\n 2002.35: cutoff he's really ad hoc cutoff ad hoc\\n 2005.53: we just sort of made this up I mean it\\n 2008.20: was a motivated it was a motivated thing\\n 2011.35: to do it was an intelligent thing to do\\n 2012.82: but we didn't it wasn't really justified\\n 2014.59: another thing that's kind of wrong is\\n 2017.44: that we used Omega proportional to wave\\n 2022.87: vector the sound law here the frequency\\n 2026.32: will be proportional to wave vector but\\n 2028.54: we use this at high K and that's not\\n 2033.31: true\\n 2033.88: sound is a small K a long wavelength\\n 2036.28: phenomenon when you go to very small\\n 2038.46: wavelengths or very high wave vector\\n 2040.66: this is no longer true so this was sort\\n 2044.08: of a problem that we brushed under the\\n 2045.40: rug\\n 2045.91: but and incidentally the the wavelengths\\n 2048.10: we're talking about when you get up near\\n 2049.90: the Debye frequency the wavelengths are\\n 2051.73: close to the inter atomic spacing so\\n 2053.71: we're talking about really really small\\n 2054.94: wavelengths or really high wave vectors\\n 2057.25: and we can't really think about sound in\\n 2058.96: that regime anymore so this is sort of a\\n 2061.78: problem we brushed under the rug another\\n 2064.24: thing is that Debye is not exact it's\\n 2067.96: not exact for any material although it's\\n 2070.78: pretty good as is obvious from that plot\\n 2072.85: and third or fourth metals are different\\n 2077.82: metals are different well for metals we\\n 2081.64: have this for metals as I mentioned last\\n 2088.21: time we have low temperature specific\\n 2090.31: heat see proportional to alpha t cubed\\n 2094.60: plus gamma T where alpha is predicted by\\n 2098.17: Debye so if you did the Debye Theory you\\n 2101.29: would get the coefficient alpha correct\\n 2103.09: but you wouldn't get gamma at all so\\n 2105.40: this is just a big question right now we\\n 2107.02: don't know where that's where that's\\n 2108.58: coming from so we have to figure that\\n 2111.85: out and in a few lectures time we'll\\n 2114.28: have a good idea where that's coming\\n 2116.29: from but for now it's it's a bit of a\\n 2117.94: mystery now you might say to me at this\\n 2120.40: point but wait a second isn't silver a\\n 2122.38: metal shouldn't I see a linear heat\\n 2125.32: capacity at low temperature\\n 2126.76: indeed silver is a metal and you should\\n 2129.07: see a linear heat capacity at low\\n 2130.69: temperature but you have to look at it\\n 2132.40: hard to see it so this is blown up the\\n 2135.37: very very low temperature regime sort of\\n 2138.34: 1 to 4 or 5 Kelvin or something like\\n 2140.68: that 1 to 4 Kelvin I guess and what's\\n 2144.13: plotted here is the heat capacity\\n 2145.09: divided by the temperature as a function\\n 2147.28: of temperature squared if it was a\\n 2149.38: purity cube law then this line would be\\n 2153.19: a straight line and would intersect zero\\n 2154.96: it obviously doesn't intersect zero it\\n 2157.99: intersects a finite intercept which is\\n 2159.82: in fact gamma so there's a very very\\n 2162.52: small term gamma this term gamma is\\n 2164.59: pretty small but it's clearly there you\\n 2166.96: have to measure pretty carefully to see\\n 2168.34: it but it's there okay all right so at\\n 2172.87: this point we've sort of done talking\\n 2176.05: about vibrations in solids for a little\\n 2177.82: while we'll come back to them later in\\n 2179.17: the term when we do a little bit of a\\n 2180.34: better job trying to understand these\\n 2182.23: things but for now we've putting this\\n 2184.99: aside and we're going to switch gears\\n 2187.30: and start talking about metals because\\n 2189.88: metals are obviously different in\\n 2191.47: several ways this is one way that\\n 2192.97: they're different but they're different\\n 2194.41: in many other ways as well and this is\\n 2196.90: something that was this was known to\\n 2198.46: known to the ancients even you know\\n 2200.74: probably in caveman days they they knew\\n 2202.69: that there were some materials they\\n 2203.80: found on the ground that just looked\\n 2204.94: different from other materials and by\\n 2206.71: 4,000 BC people were able to work with\\n 2208.87: certain metals things like like copper\\n 2211.03: and then a couple thousand years later\\n 2212.35: they were able to work with iron and\\n 2213.64: each time they were able to command a\\n 2215.38: particular metal and work with it they\\n 2217.30: were able to make new things do new\\n 2218.92: devices new technologies and really\\n 2221.38: change the history of humankind so you\\n 2223.66: know starting with metal plows metal\\n 2226.21: swords metal armor metal warfare of all\\n 2228.61: sorts\\n 2229.18: then later on metal machines you have\\n 2231.58: metal skyscrapers you know the nuclear\\n 2233.80: age was brought in by you know heavy\\n 2235.45: metals and heavy metal music very\\n 2238.03: important also\\n 2239.58: but metals you know the history of\\n 2241.75: metals in some way traces the history of\\n 2244.26: mankind and you know it wasn't until\\n 2247.66: really the late 1800s that anyone had\\n 2249.67: the remotest idea what causes metals to\\n 2252.28: be different and really in 2000's before\\n 2255.64: we really understood the properties of\\n 2257.47: metals you have to remember you know for\\n 2259.27: us the the defining property of a metal\\n 2261.61: is going to be that it conducts\\n 2263.08: electricity and nonmetals don't but\\n 2266.15: we didn't even know what what\\n 2267.29: electricity was until the late 1800s it\\n 2269.33: was 1897 before JJ Thompson discovered\\n 2272.63: the electron or what he called the small\\n 2275.03: corpuscle of charge that can move around\\n 2276.83: freely in the metals and could be\\n 2278.87: ejected out of the metal by a\\n 2280.43: sufficiently high voltage and with this\\n 2284.48: picture of the metal really being sort\\n 2286.85: of a container for all these electrons\\n 2288.44: running around there became a natural\\n 2290.42: thing for people to do which was to\\n 2292.37: consider these electrons running around\\n 2293.78: as a gas a gas of electrons and this is\\n 2296.72: what Paul's Ruda did was known as Judah\\n 2300.05: theory of metals of metals well Arjuna\\n 2304.28: theory of transport applies to metals\\n 2306.38: and it's actually particularly good it\\n 2307.79: works this Drude a theory it's a very\\n 2309.65: crude classical kinetic theory kinetic\\n 2314.66: theory of electrons of electrons very\\n 2320.51: much like the kinetic theory of gases\\n 2322.28: that you studied last year in your\\n 2324.32: thermal physics course it works\\n 2326.57: extremely well despite the fact that is\\n 2328.70: very crude it works extremely well for a\\n 2330.26: lot of things particularly well for\\n 2331.91: semiconductors and so we're going to\\n 2333.80: attack you know electron transport in in\\n 2338.00: metals using this beauty Theory first\\n 2340.25: and then we'll improve on it later so as\\n 2343.37: with your last year's kinetic theory we\\n 2346.70: have a couple of assumptions assume in\\n 2351.26: order to get kinetic theory going one\\n 2353.30: there's a scattering time scattering\\n 2357.89: time tau should look familiar from last\\n 2361.73: year by which we mean that the\\n 2364.04: probability of scattering probability of\\n 2366.14: scat in time T or in time DT is equal to\\n 2373.69: DT over tau now this probably looks\\n 2377.06: familiar from last year when you did\\n 2378.41: kinetic theory of gases last year we\\n 2381.26: need to connect their gases you can even\\n 2382.70: predict what the scattering time tau is\\n 2385.07: based on the size of the atoms and how\\n 2387.11: fast they're moving and things like that\\n 2388.64: this year we're not going to be so lucky\\n 2390.50: for a couple reasons first of all it\\n 2393.26: isn't clear what the scattering\\n 2394.76: cross-section of the electron should be\\n 2396.32: because the electrons interact with\\n 2398.03: things via a long-range colon\\n 2399.65: so they could they could scatter from\\n 2401.42: things very far away potentially another\\n 2403.55: thing that's going to make it difficult\\n 2405.05: to figure out what Tao is is that the\\n 2406.79: electron can scatter off of lots of\\n 2408.26: other things besides just other\\n 2409.58: electrons it can scatter off of protons\\n 2411.77: it can scatter off of impurities it can\\n 2413.42: scatter off of anything in it happens to\\n 2415.94: be in the metal so for us this\\n 2418.10: scattering time tau is just gonna be a\\n 2419.84: phenomenological parameter the second\\n 2422.78: thing we're going to assume is after\\n 2425.33: scattering after a scattering event\\n 2427.85: after scatter we will set the final\\n 2432.29: momentum equal to zero so you imagine\\n 2435.59: something you know something moving\\n 2437.24: along it scatters and then it's final\\n 2439.07: momentum is zero now that's not right\\n 2441.08: generally when something scatters its\\n 2443.03: final momentum goes off randomly in some\\n 2444.92: random direction but on average as a\\n 2448.34: vector the average of the vector after\\n 2450.59: the scattering is pretty close to zero\\n 2452.06: because it can go off in any possible\\n 2454.04: direction and that's going to be good\\n 2455.57: enough for us to be able to make\\n 2457.55: progress the Third Point which you\\n 2460.91: probably didn't have last year is that\\n 2462.77: between scattering events between\\n 2464.39: scatters the electron should see sees E\\n 2473.92: and B field if they happen to be there\\n 2477.86: so if you're applying an electric field\\n 2479.87: to your metal the electron will\\n 2481.34: accelerate due to the electric field or\\n 2483.02: it will curve due to the magnetic field\\n 2484.49: which seems rather natural just like the\\n 2486.68: electron we're living in a vacuum okay\\n 2489.16: so given these three assumptions we can\\n 2493.22: imagine that we start with an electron\\n 2495.68: that has momentum P at time T so P of T\\n 2498.53: is momentum well okay that's obvious at\\n 2500.75: time T time T and then we'd like to\\n 2506.87: calculate what is the momentum at time T\\n 2510.26: plus DT I mean in some ways we're asking\\n 2513.17: what's the expectation of the momentum\\n 2515.15: at time T plus DT but we'll treat it as\\n 2517.64: the actual momentum at time T plus DT\\n 2520.84: well there's two things that can happen\\n 2522.95: in between time T and time T plus DT\\n 2525.62: with probably one minus DT over tau this\\n 2530.15: is the probability this is probability\\n 2531.80: of knots\\n 2532.49: chattering prob of not scattering not\\n 2535.76: scattering if it does not scatter then\\n 2539.12: what happens well then it has the\\n 2541.13: regional momentum plus whatever force is\\n 2544.31: applied to it times DT and that's just\\n 2547.28: okay this is just saying that DP DT if\\n 2551.21: it doesn't scatter is F Newton's law\\n 2555.13: good but in addition to this there's\\n 2559.22: also the probability a probability DT\\n 2562.10: over T that it does scatter and if it\\n 2564.53: does scatter we give it momentum zero\\n 2568.09: okay so this is the probability of not\\n 2571.73: scattering it accelerates as usual due\\n 2574.07: to the force applied to it and if it\\n 2575.96: does scatter we give it momentum zero\\n 2578.21: after the scattering okay then we can do\\n 2580.64: a little bit of rearrangement here well\\n 2582.53: actually maybe let's multiply this out\\n 2583.79: first so this is then P of T plus F DT\\n 2590.68: minus P over tau and then there's DT and\\n 2596.95: then there's plus order DT squared and\\n 2600.79: with a little bit of rearrangement we\\n 2603.11: can write DP DT which should be P at T\\n 2609.68: plus DT minus P of T over DT yell at me\\n 2617.81: if I start writing incomprehensibly you\\n 2619.91: know if it really gets too painful and\\n 2622.09: just doing a little bit of a\\n 2623.72: rearrangement on that equation up there\\n 2625.22: and putting together this combination we\\n 2627.98: get F minus P over tau so let me rewrite\\n 2632.63: this because this is an important\\n 2634.28: equation DP DT equals force minus T over\\n 2641.30: tau this is known as the Drude a\\n 2643.16: transport equation juda and what force\\n 2648.05: are you supposed to use in it well the\\n 2649.91: force is the usual Lorentz force force\\n 2651.95: is a minus e E Plus V cross B\\n 2657.85: so whatever force the electron feels\\n 2660.22: goes into that that equation so this\\n 2664.00: looks a lot like Newton's equation DP DT\\n 2666.64: equals F is Newton's equation but we\\n 2668.14: have this additional term on the right\\n 2670.15: hand side which looks like a drag force\\n 2672.01: it's a force going in the opposite\\n 2673.90: direction from its current momentum so\\n 2676.63: whichever direction is going the force\\n 2677.92: is pulling in the opposite direction so\\n 2680.26: let's actually do a really quick\\n 2682.00: calculation here let's consider consider\\n 2685.21: the case where there's no no electric or\\n 2690.67: magnetic fields in your system so you're\\n 2692.92: not applying any electric or magnetic\\n 2694.09: field then you just have DP DT is minus\\n 2699.24: P over tau which you can solve by saying\\n 2703.78: P of T is some peanuts some initial\\n 2706.75: momentum e to the minus T over tau so\\n 2710.98: that tells us that the momentum if I\\n 2713.86: have an electron moving along with some\\n 2715.45: initial momentum this scattering term\\n 2717.97: here slows it down exponentially to zero\\n 2721.38: momentum with a time scale tau so it's\\n 2725.20: like a drag so that the idea of the dru\\n 2727.63: to theory is that you treat scattering\\n 2729.55: as a drag force that tries to slow\\n 2731.41: everything down or hinder it's it's\\n 2733.51: motion and I guess we will stop there\\n 2735.46: and we'll pick up withdrew the theory\\n 2736.51: next time I'll see you tomorrow\\n 2740.15: [Applause]\""

The speaker then introduces the Drude theory of metals, which is a classical kinetic theory that treats electrons in metals as a gas. They discuss'"
